# Push notifications

Push notifications are small, pop-up messages that Xaman (formerly Xumm) will display on your phone to alert you of various transactions on your XRP Ledger account. Push notifications cover real-time transactional messages, updates, support messages and more, all of which will help keep you up-to-date on your XRPL account.

### _Frequently asked Questions_

#### What are some of the push  notifications I will receive?

Here is an example from a typical phone running Android:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/push notification - 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Notice the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the image and the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (4) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> on the Xumm icon. These are indicators that there has been some activity on your account.

If you tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line"> you can view the details of the activity. Here are a couple examples of push notifications sent by Xumm:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/push notification - 1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the first example, you can see that a payment of .000001 XRP was received in the XRPL account labelled "Will" and in the second example you can see that the Xaman Support team has replied to a ticket created via the [Xaman Support xApp](broken-reference).

#### Where can I find this in Pro?

Once you go into the **Push notifications** section, you should see a list of accounts you can enable push notifications for.

This need to be enabled in order to receive push notifications.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I am not receiving receiving push notifications while I am in Xaman.

You will only receive push notifications if Xaman is **not running**. If you are in the application, push notifications will not be sent. (You can always check the Events log for any activity on your account.)

#### I was receiving notifications but now I am not getting them any more.

1\) Go into Pro, select **Push Notifications**, then **Disable** the account you are not receiving notifications on.

2\) Exit Xaman, then launch Xaman and launch Pro, select **Push Notifications**, then **Enable** the account.

3\) Exit Xaman, then have someone send XRP to your account to test it.\
\
Note: Basically you are disabling push notifications on the account, then re-enabling push notifications.  Remember, you Xaman has to be closed in order to receive notifications.
