# Setting up your Xumm Profile

### Before you get started...

This article will walk you through the steps to create your Xumm Profile and public PayString link.

It assumes that you have already reviewed both of these articles and understand what Xumm Profiles and PayString are all about.&#x20;

There are two steps that you need to do before you can create your Xumm profile:

* Go through the **KYC process**
* Ensure one or more **accounts** are linked to Xumm Pro and ensure at least one of them is public

Here is how to do this:

On the main page of Xumm Pro, press the _**Open KYC xApp**_ button and complete the KYC process.&#x20;

Next, press the **Accounts** button then decide which account(s) you would like to link to your public profile and press the **Edit** button.

Enabling the **Show on Profile** option will make the account publicly viewable on your Profile page.

Once you have completed the process, the next step is to press the **Create Profile** button...

then you can create your Profile.

After you have completed entering your Profile and PayString information, press the **Finish** button to complete the process. You should see this screen:

Press the **Go back** button to get back to the main screen of Xumm Pro.



### Additional Information

#### Understanding how your Profile name works

After you enter your name in the **Setup you profile** page,

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2) (1) (1).png>)

Xumm will compare it to the KYC document that you submitted during the KYC process. While the name that you choose does not need to match the KYC document exactly, it should be very close, otherwise you will receive this message:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Request an exception.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Remember, the point of Profiles is to create an **honest identity** for yourself. One that can be **trusted** by others in the XRPL community.&#x20;

Here is an example of how to choose your name.

If your name is <mark style="color:blue;">John Smith</mark> but you enter the name: <mark style="color:red;">Elon Musk</mark> Xumm will reject this since the entered name you entered is not reflected on your KYC document.

Xumm would accept slight variations of you name such as: <mark style="color:blue;">JSmith</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">JohnS</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">Johnny Smith</mark>

If you are receiving a message saying that you name does not match your legal document, try a couple of variations of your name or request an exception along with an explanation as to why you think you should receive an exception.

Exceptions will be considered on a case by case basis.

#### Understanding how your Profile picture works

After you upload your picture in the **Setup you profile** page,

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (3).png>)

Xumm will compare it to the KYC document that you submitted during the KYC process. The image that you upload should be a picture of you, otherwise you will receive this message:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Profile Picture - Error-1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Remember, the point of Profiles is to create an **honest identity** for yourself. One that can be **trusted** by others in the XRPL community. If you still receive the above message after trying a couple of variations of your picture, try submitting an exception request with an explanation as to why you think you should receive an exception.

Exceptions will be considered on a case by case basis.
