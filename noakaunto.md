#### Three things to get you started... <a href="#three-things-to-get-you-started" id="three-things-to-get-you-started"></a>

Congratulations! Getting a new phone can be exciting, but before you get started migrating everything over from your old phone, here are a couple of suggestions to make the process a little smoother...

* Do not get rid of your old phone until your new phone has been properly setup and is working as expected.
* Ensure that you have the account secret (Secret numbers / Family seed / Mnemonic) for your XRP Ledger account.
* If you are unsure how to proceed or need clarification on any of the steps in this article, contact us via the [Xumm Support xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support).

#### Configuring Xumm on your new phone <a href="#configuring-xumm-on-your-new-phone" id="configuring-xumm-on-your-new-phone"></a>

#### Frequently asked questions <a href="#frequently-asked-questions" id="frequently-asked-questions"></a>

**Why did you ask me to keep my old phone?**

We have seen cases where people have forgotten their account secret or recorded their account secret incorrectly. Your old phone should still be able to access your XRP Ledger account(s) in case you run into any trouble configuring your new phone. Once you are able to access and sign transactions on your new device, you can uninstall Xumm from your old device.

**Why can't I restore Xumm from backup?**

If Xumm were to store sensitive data, (like your account secrets) in a Google / Apple iCloud backup, an attacker gaining access to your Google / Apple account(s) would be able to restore a backup of your device to their own device, resulting in the loss of your cryptocurrency funds.This is why it's really important to keep your account secret stored offline, in a secure place.

**What about my Xumm Tangem card accounts?**

If you have Xumm Tangem cards, you will need to re-import them into Xumm on your new phone.If you need assist doing this, check out this article:[![](https://www.gitbook.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=371,dpr=2,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2F3130654347-files.gitbook.io%2F\~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%2FMiHAzvIPISVuuzt0AeOR%2Fuploads%2F5UHfOD1xTNHfekIdArOn%2FImage%20-%20X.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd0db609b-09d4-4f40-a444-f26fd4ee66c8)How to add a Xumm (Tangem) card](https://help.xumm.app/app/getting-started-with-xumm/importing-your-account/...a-xumm-tangem-card)

**My account was created during the Casino Coin swap. How do I access it?**
