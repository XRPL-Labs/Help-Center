# How to test your Account Secret

Do you have multiple XRP Ledger accounts?&#x20;

What would happen if you mixed up your account secrets (Secret numbers / Mnemonics / Family Seeds) and didn't know which one belonged to which account?

Xumm has a way for you to check!&#x20;

### Getting started

1\) Launch Xumm and press the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2).png>)button at the top right hand corner of the screen, then press <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

You should see this screen:

2\) Press the **Import an existing account** button. You will see:

3\) Press the **Next** button.  You should see this screen:

4\) Choose the Account Secret type matching the account secret that you have. (Secret numbers / Family Seed / Mnemonic) then press the **Next** button.

5\) Enter your Account Secret then press the **Next** button.\

If your account is already imported into Xumm, you will receive the follow message:
