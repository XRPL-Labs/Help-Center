Simply tap the amount of XRP that you have on the main screen...

### **How does Xumm calculate the "value" of my XRP?**

We actually created an "XRPL Price Oracle" to provide this information.

[https://dev.to/wietse/aggregated-xrp-usd-price-info-on-the-xrp-ledger-1087](https://dev.to/wietse/aggregated-xrp-usd-price-info-on-the-xrp-ledger-1087)

Anyone in the XRP Ledger community can query Oracle to get the current XRP value, which is a weighted average from multiple exchanges.

### **What if I want to know the value of all my tokens?**

We have an xApp called [**Account Worth**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.accountworth) which displays that information.

### **How do I change the currency that is displayed?**

You can set the currency for Xumm by pressing **Settings** -> **General** -> **Currency**
