# How to release an escrow

Once you have created the escrow, you can not access it again using the xApp, but you can access it via xrpl.services.

Just login to xrpl.services, go to "EscrowCreate" and you will see all your escrows and an option to enable the auto release if it is not yet enabled for that escrow.



After I create an escrow using the xApp, the last step is the Escrow Auto Release

If I don't choose it while in the app, can I somehow go back and choose it later?

not in the xApp no

but you can enable that through the website xrpl.services

login, go to "EscrowCreate" and you will see all your escrows and an option to enable the auto release if it is not yet enabled for that escrow

you can also finish escrows there if you haven't enabled the auto release (open "EscrowFInish" for that. it will load all available escrows which can be finished

"it still didnt bring the finish option in blue colour after filling the owner wallet and the sequence number but it brings it after i enter a random password which i didnt set a password for the esrow"

The escrow guy who didn't create a password.

I asked him to try this:

1. Go here: [https://xrpl.services/](https://xrpl.services/)
2. Login using your account. (The one with the escrow)
3. Select Escrow Finish.
4. Fill in the fields with the correct information.
5. Press 'Send Escrow finish to Xumm'

Edited

Did I miss something?

he doesn't have to fill out anything

he logs in using the accoutn which created the escrow or with the destination

goes to "EscrowFinish", opens the tab and opens the Escrows (there is a list available)

then he simply selects the escrow from this list
