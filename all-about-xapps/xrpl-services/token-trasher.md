# Token Trasher

The Token Trasher xApp is a utility that allows you to:

* remove unwanted tokens from your XRP Ledger account
* delete unwanted Trust Lines from your XRPL account

This xApp gives you the ability to swap your tokens for XRP (if applicable), send any left over tokens back to the token issuer and remove unwanted Trust Lines.

#### Can I select multiple tokens or Trust Lines to be removed at once?

Unfortunately no. The XRP Ledger does not allow batch signing. This means that you can only remove one Trust Line at a time.

#### Will I get my 2 XRP back for the owner reserve?

Yes. Once your Trust Line has been removed, the 2 XRP held in reserve by the XRPL will be made available for spending.

#### Can I recover my 10 XRP held for the base reserve with this xApp?

No. The Base Reserve is a minimum amount of XRP that is required for each address in the ledger. The only way to recover the base reserve is to delete your account from the XRPL.
