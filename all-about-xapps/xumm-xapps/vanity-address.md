# Vanity Address xApp

### Overview

A Vanity address is a customized XRP Ledger account address.  The idea behind a Vanity account is to give people the option to personalize their XRP Ledger r-addresses. It is a nice way to make a statement and to own a customized address that will be immortalized on the the XRP Ledger.

The Vanity Address xApp lets you choose from over **400** **billion** pre-mined r-address which start with your name / handle /brand. so you can find the right one for you. Instead of a random account address (starting with a lower case "r") you will have an account address that starts with a lower case r and then a short value that you can choose.

For example, can you guess what our favorite movie is?

... or our favorite band?

This xApp is perfect for helping you customize your public imagine by picking a unique, individual r-address on the XRP Ledger.

### Costs

The normal cost of a vanity account is € 50 per account.&#x20;

If you subscribe to Xumm Pro (Beta), you receive a 20% discount on all Vanity purchases which brings the price down to € 40 per vanity account.

### How it works

You may have noticed in the Overview section, we mentioned we have over 400 billion pre-mined accounts. The 'pre-mined' part means that we have tested and stored the private keys for all of those accounts.  If you would like to purchase one of them, we can't just give you the private keys for it. If we did, how could you trust us to get rid of them after we gave them to you? (Well, we are trust worthy, but still, you can't trust anyone when it comes to your private keys.)

The solution to this conundrum lies in the XRP Ledger itself. One of the great features of the XRPL is the ability to 're-key' an account. An XRP Ledger account can authorize a secondary key pair, called a _regular key pair_. After doing so, you can use either the master key pair or the regular key to authorize transactions.&#x20;

When you purchase a Vanity account, we configure a regular key pair pointing to another you already own. We then disable the master key for the Vanity account, meaning we will never be able to sign with it. Only you will be able to, with the key pair (your account secret) belonging to the account we re-keyed to.

Hint!&#x20;

Before you decide to purchase a Vanity account, you should already have an activated XRP Ledger account that will be used to sign transactions on you account.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### You have almost half a trillion r-addresses and their private keys, have you ever had any collisions?

Actually, we have never checked, but the chances of us stumbling across an existing key pair is **very** remote. It has taken us years to generate the existing key pairs we have. Even if we could generate 390 trillion key pairs per hour, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, it would take about 99 quadrillion years to go through all 340 undecillion possibilities. The chances of a collision is practically impossible.&#x20;
