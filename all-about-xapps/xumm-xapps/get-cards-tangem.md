# Get Cards

### Use case

The Get Cards xApp is a utility that allows you to:

* purchase [**Xumm cards**](../../xaman-tangem-cards/xumm-tangem-cards.md)
* purchase [**Xumm Pro (Beta)**](xumm-pro-beta.md)
* purchase a limited amount of XRP&#x20;

### **How do I find it?**

Tap this link:

[Get Cards xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.tangem-order)

or you can find it by pressing the **xApps** button at the bottom of the main screen in Xumm.

### How do I use it?

1\) Launching the [Get cards xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.tangem-order) displays the following screen:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Press the **Order cards** button...&#x20;

2\) The purchase process consists of 4 steps.&#x20;

**Step 1** involves:

* choosing the number of Xumm cards you would like to purchase.

Currently we offer quantities of 2, 3,4 or 5 cards. (We do not offer bulk orders.)&#x20;

If you decide to go with the 5 card option, the team will even sign one for you!

* deciding if you would like to purchase XRP to cover the [**account reserve**](../../xrp-ledger-resources/xrp-ledger-concepts/about-reserves.md) for one card. (This option allows you to purchase 10 XRP to meet the account reserve requirement of the XRPL. )
* deciding  if you would like to purchase extra XRP in addition to the 10 XRP for the account reserve.

Note: There is a 10% premium (round up to the nearest 5) for this service.

When done, press the **Continue to payment** button.

**Step 3**

Choose how you would like to pay for your cards and Pro subscription.

If you are not going to purchase additional XRP, paying with Xaman (in XRP) is quick, easy and will save you money. (We recommend this option.)

If you are purchasing additional XRP, you are going to choose to pay with a Credit Card.

Note: A 10% premium applies (rounded to the nearest 5) for paying with a credit card.
