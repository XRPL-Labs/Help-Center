## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I have to apply for my balance adjustment every month?

Yes. The balance adjustment period resets every 30 days, 2 hours and 13 minutes. Once this amount of time expires, repeat these steps to receive the next balance adjustment.

#### Why do I have to enroll every month?

The idea of this feature is to reward frequent users of the network. This incentive is designed to encourage people to participate more frequently.

#### Does this xApp work for XRP as well?

No, the Balance Adjustment is for the Xahau network only. The XRP Ledger does not have a feature like this.

#### If I have more XAH tokens do I get a higher payout?

No. The adjustment rate is the same regardless of the balance of XAH you have in your account. If you have 1 XAH or a million XAH, you still receive 4% per annum.

#### Is this like staking on other networks?

Sort of.&#x20;

Generally, there are two types of staking in the blockchain space.

1\) Crypto exchanges will allow you to lock up your tokens with them and pay you rewards for doing this.&#x20;

2\) Proof of Stake networks (Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Tezos, etc.) allow you to lock up your tokens&#x20;

On the Xahau network, you don't have to lock up your XAH. You can use them anytime, however, the XAH tokens have to be in your account for the entire period.

#### How do I see the history of my claims?

At the top left hand corner of the Balance Adjustment xApp is a **History** button. If you press it, you should see a history of your balance adjustment claims. Here's an example:

#### When I signed the transaction to Opt-in, I had to pay a network fee. Is this normal?

Yes. The Xahau network charges fees to submit a transaction to the network. (Although, the fees are so low, transactions are basically free.) The history screen shows the Fee paid to Opt-in is returned in the balance adjustment total.
