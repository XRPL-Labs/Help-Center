# Balance Adjustment

### Purpose

The Balance Adjustment xApp allows you to access the _BalanceRewards_ amendment on the Xahau network and claim a percentage of your average monthly balance in XAH coins.

### **How do I find it?**

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I have to apply for my balance adjustment every month?

Yes. The balance adjustment period resets every 30 days, 2 hours and 13 minutes. Once this amount of time expires, repeat these steps to receive the next balance adjustment.

#### Why do I have to enroll every month?

The idea of this feature is to reward frequent users of the network. This incentive is designed to encourage people to participate more frequently.

#### How do I see the history of my claims?

At the top left hand corner of the Balance Adjustment xApp is a **History** button. If you press it, you should see a history of your balance adjustment claims. Here's an example:

#### When I signed the transaction to Opt-in, I had to pay a network fee. Is this normal?

Yes. The Xahau network charges fees to submit a transaction to the network. (Although, the fees are so low, transactions are basically free.) The history screen shows the Fee paid to Opt-in is returned in the balance adjustment total.
