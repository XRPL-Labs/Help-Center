# Voucher

### Concept and Purpose

When people think of vouchers, they might imagine a small printed piece of paper that entitles the holder to a discount or maybe something like an Amazon voucher which is not really a discount code, but is actual money that people can use to buy merchandise on the Amazon platform.

The Voucher xApp allows you to create a digital voucher which contains the XAH coin for the Xahau network.

### Use case for Vouchers

For those who remember TipBot, (a widget built by XRPL Labs back in 2015), it would allow anyone to send XRP on Twitter just using their Twitter handle. It was an easy and safe way to tip people with XRP. Unfortunately, TipBot was discontinued because the XRP Ledger did not possess the features to make it compliant with emerging crypto regulations. Things are different with Xahau. Xahau is an updated and modern version of the XRPL protocol which includes smart contracts. (known as 'Hooks')

Utilizing hooks, the Vouchers xApp allows you easily start tipping people on Twitter DMs, email, SMS or other social media platform by sending them the link to Voucher QR Code. The best part? Vouchers are 100% complaint with all current and future crypto rules and regulations!

In addition to tipping people, Vouchers can also be used to activate accounts on the Xahau network of send XAH coins to someone as a gift. Maybe you've been looking for a way to get a friend interested in the exciting world of blockchain? Send them a voucher which they can redeem as XAH!&#x20;
