# XAH Teleport

### Purpose

The XAH Teleport xApp allows you to move XAH tokens (issued by GateHub) from your XRP Ledger account over to your Xahau account on the Xahau network and vice versa.

### **How do I install it?**

You can install the XAH Teleport xApp on either network and it will work on both networks.

Simply tap this link: [**XAH Teleport**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xahau.teleport) to install it or, if you are viewing this article on a computer, scan this QR code with Xaman:

### **How do I use it?**

The first thing you need to decide is which way you would like to send your XAH tokens/coins.

You can press the '**Invert direction**' button to switch between the XRP Ledger and the Xahau network.

You'll know which way the tokens/coins are moving by looking at the following areas:

The next thing to decide is how much you would like to send.&#x20;

You have three options:

* A minimum amount
* A midpoint amount
* A maximum amount

These amounts are determined based on the balance of your account.

Simple chose from one of the three options by tapping it.... the xApp will handle the rest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### Why can't I manually select the amount I want to teleport?

The XAH Teleport xApp is meant to be a quick, easy and convenient way to move XAH between networks. It is not meant to be a replacement for a crypto exchange. If you would like to move a specific amount of XAH between networks, you can create an account with GateHub and manually move as much (or as little) XAH as you like.

#### What is the minimum / maximum amount of XAH that can be moved at one time?

* Minimum = 0.5 XAH
* Maximum = 1000 XAH

#### Can I send my XAH from my account to a different account?

No. You can only send XAH from your account to the same r-address on the other network.\
\
For example:

On the XRP Ledger you have an account:&#x20;

* rStargateYHGUdFGeusi34tr

&#x20;and on the Xahau network you have three accounts:

* rStargateYHGUdFGeusi34tr
* rXahauf8jUF076HGhhtyf45
* rTradingdhru49gKJH9314ml

You could not send your XAH to rXahauf8jUF076HGhhtyf45 or rTradingdhru49gKJH9314ml.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only send XAH to the **same account** r-address on the other network.\
\
ie. rStargateYHGUdFGeusi34tr on the the XRP Ledger to rStargateYHGUdFGeusi34tr on the Xahau network and vice versa.
{% endhint %}

#### What if I encounter this screen?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The, "The payload is not available on the network you are connect with" message means that you are not connected to the correct network.

If you would like to send XAH tokens from the XRP Ledger to the Xahau network, you have to be on the XRPL network to begin the process.

If you would like to send XAH coins the Xahau network to the XRPL, you have to be on the Xahau network to begin the process.

Fortunately, you just need to tap the 'Switch network' button and switch networks and you should be able to proceed.

#### Can I activate my account using Teleport? send my XAH from my account to a different account?

No. Your Xahau must be activated prior to using the XAH Teleport xApp.

You can activate your Xahau for free by following the instructions in this article:
