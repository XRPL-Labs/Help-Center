# How to create a XAH Trust Line in your XRPL account

The easiest way to create XAH Trust line in your XRPL account is via the Xaman short list.

The "short list" is the list of tokens that is presented when you press the _**+Add**_ button on the main screen of Xaman.

Xaman will display a screen that looks like this:

From here you can simply select, **Gatehub**, then choose XAH (Xahau).&#x20;

then press **Sign to add Token.**

Xaman will craft a transaction with the details of the XAH Trust line and after you have reviewed them, you can **Slide to accept**. &#x20;
