# How to send XAH from GateHub

### Summary

This article provides instructions on how to send XAH coins from your GateHub account (Hosted, Self custodial - XRPL, or Self custodial - Xahau) to your Xahau account managed by Xaman.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are doing this for the first time, please be aware that the first XAH coin sent to a Xahau account is used to fulfill the base reserve requirement of the Xahau network. This process is known as 'activating an account". You can read more about this [here](../understanding-reserves-on-xahau.md).

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I hold XAH coins in my GateHub account?

Yes and no.

**Yes.** GateHub has several different types of accounts. If you create a Xahau account on the Xahau network using the GateHub platform, you can hold XAH coins in your account.

**No.** If you have an XRP Ledger account or a Hosted account with GateHub, you can not hold XAH coins. Any XAH coins you send to either of these accounts are automatically converted to GateHub's issued XAH tokens. (GH-XAH).  However, you can send GH-XAH tokens from your XRPL/Hosted GateHub accounts to your self-custodial Xahau account and they will be automatically converted back to XAH coins. (GateHub exchanges them for you in the background.)

#### Can I activate a Xahau account with my GH-XAH tokens?

Yes and No.&#x20;

**Yes.** If you own XAH tokens issued by GateHub (GH-XAH) in your XRP Ledger account managed by Xaman (formerly Xumm), you can send them to either of your XRPL/Hosted GateHub accounts, then send them to your self-custodial Xahau account. GateHub will automatically exchange your GH-XAH into XAH coins and send them to your Xahau account.&#x20;

**No.** If you own XAH tokens issued by GateHub (GH-XAH) in your XRP Ledger account managed by Xaman (formerly Xumm), you **can not directly** activate a Xahau account with them. (ie. you can not send the GH-XAH tokens directly to the Xahau network using Xaman.)  You have to send your GH-XAH to your GateHub account first, then send it to your self-custodial Xahau account from there.
