# Activating a Xahau account

Having an account on the Xahau network will allow you to participate in the Xahau ecosystem. With an activated account you can,  send and receive payments,  place buy and sell offers on the Xahau DEX. utilize Hooks (smart contracts), create escrows, and use all of the other features that Xahau provides.

Since everything on Xahau involves having an activated account, this article explains the various way you can activate yours.

## The Four ways

An account on Xahau is activated when a minimum of 1 XAH is sent to it.  The first XAH coin is locked by the Xahau network and is used to cover the base reserve (wallet reserve) requirement of the Xahau network. It can not be accessed, spent or recovered.\

There are four main ways to activate an account on the Xahau network:

1\) 'Duplicate' an existing XRP Ledger (XRPL) account.

2\) Buy XAH tokens on the XRPL DEX, then send them to your Gatehub account and activate your Xahau account from GateHub

3\) Buy XAH coins/tokens on the GateHub platform and activate your Xahau from your account with them

4\) Buy XAH coins on the Bitrue platform and activate your Xahau from your account with them.

## Discussing each method

#### 1) 'D**uplicating' an existing XRP Ledger account**

Many people will have an  existing XRPL account managed with Xaman (formerly Xumm). If you already have an activated XRPL account managed by Xaman, you can 'duplicate' it on the Xahau network using the Xahau Import xApp which has been specifically designed for this purpose.

The benefit of using the xApp is that it will automatically copy the settings of your current XRPL account over to the Xahau network and activate the new account with **2 free XAH coins**.

That's correct. You will receive 2 free XAH coins by using the Xahau Import xApp.

There are three ways to duplicate an account, depending on what type of XRPL account you have:

* Duplicating a regular. normal XRPL account - This is just a standard XRPL account created using Xumm/Xaman.&#x20;
* Duplicating a Xumm(Tangem) card account - This is an account created using a Xumm (Tangem) card.
* Duplicating a Vanity account - This is an account created using the [Vanity xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.vanity).

2\) **Via an exchange**\
\
Crypto exchanges like Bitrue and Gatehub support the Xahau network. You can purchase XAH on their platform, then send the XAH to your Xahau account managed by Xaman. You will find instructions on how to do this here:

3\) **Via another Xahau account**

If you already have XAH in a Xahau account, you can send XAH coins between your accounts to activate them. This applies to your friends, family and  co-workers as well. If they have a Xahau account, they can send XAH to your account to activate it. In fact, any Xahau account can be activated from any other Xahau account. They just need to send 1 XAH from it to your account.
