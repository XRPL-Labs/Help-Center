# How to trade XAH coins

### History

On November 1, 2023 a new blockchain was launched called **Xahau**.

Xahau is an XRP Ledger protocol based network, introducing several new features, such as Hooks, not found on the XRPL mainnet.&#x20;

One of the things introduced in Xahau is a new native coin with the trading symbol of **XAH**. The primary purpose of the XAH coin is to offset the higher fees encountered from Hook/Smart Contract transactions and pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

### Understanding the difference between XAH coins and XAH tokens

The XAH coin is the native currency on the Xahau network. It exists on the Xahau network and can be used to pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

A XAH token is an issued currency on another network. (In this case, the XRP Ledger.) It exists on a different network than Xahau. A XAH token can not be used to pay transaction costs on Xahau and can not be directly moved to the Xahau network.
