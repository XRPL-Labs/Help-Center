# How to send XAH tokens to GateHub

## Overview

The GateHub crypto exchange has two main types of accounts:

* Hosted accounts
* Self custodial accounts

and there are three types of GateHub accounts that are relevant to Xaman:

* Self custodial XRP Ledger accounts
* Self custodial Xahau accounts
* Hosted accounts

This article explains how to send XAH tokens and XAH coins from Xaman to the various GateHub account types.

## Before we get started...

Before we continue, you should have a basic understanding of the difference between XAH coins and XAH tokens.

#### XAH coins

Xahau coins are the native currency on the Xahau network. They were issued on the Xahau network and exist on the Xahau network. They are used to pay transaction fees on the network and they do not require a Trust Line to hold them in an account. As well, they can not directly be moved off of Xahau.

#### XAH Tokens

Xahau tokens are issued assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).  They exist on the XRPL and represent XAH coins on the Xahau network. You can think of them as IOUs for XAH coins. They require a Trust Line to hold them in an XRPL account and can not directly be moved off of the XRPL.
