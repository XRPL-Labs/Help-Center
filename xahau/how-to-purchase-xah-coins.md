# How to purchase XAH coins

### History

On November 1, 2023 a new XRP Ledger (XRPL) sidechain was launched called **Xahau**.

The Xahau network runs the same code as the XRPL protocol but introduces several new features not found on the main XRPL blockchain.&#x20;

One of the things introduced in Xahau is a new coin with the trading symbol of **XAH**. The primary purpose of XAH is to pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

### Understanding the difference between XAH coins and XAH tokens

The XAH coin is the native currency on the Xahau network. It exists on the Xahau network and can be used to pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

A XAH token is an issued currency on another network. (In this case, the XRP Ledger.) It exists on a different network than Xahau. A XAH token can not be used to pay transaction costs on Xahau and can not be directly moved to the Xahau network.

For a more in-depth discussion about  XAH tokens and how they work, check out this article:

### How to buy XAH coins

There is currently **no way to purchase XAH coins** using Xaman.

In order to purchase XAH coins, you need to open an account with either of the following two crypto exchanges :

[**GateHub** ](https://signin.gatehub.net/signup)

[**Bitrue**](https://www.bitrue.com/user/register)

In both cases, once you have created an account with them, you will be able to send fiat money to your account with them, then exchange it for XAH coins. Once you have done that, you can refer to the following articles to send your XAH coins to your Xahau account managed by Xaman.

### How to buy XAH tokens

There is currently **one way to purchase XAH tokens** using Xaman:

* Via the XRP Ledger Digital EXchange. (DEX)

The XRPL DEX is basically a large market place where people can buy and sell different assets. You can place buy and sell orders on the DEX for XAH tokens using various websites, utilities or wallets, but Xaman has a built in feature which automates the process for you.

Here's how:

1\) Create a Trust line for the XAH token.

You can do this but pressing the **+Add** button on the main screen of Xaman:

then choose the **XAH (Xahau)** token and press the **Sign to add token** button.

2\) Tap the **XAH (Xahau) GateHub XAH** Trust line on the main screen of Xaman, then press the **Exchange** button.

#### Is there any other way I can purchase Xahau tokens?

Yes. GateHub sells both XAH tokens and XAH coins. Once you create an account with GateHub you should have the option of purchasing both.

#### Can I move my XAH tokens on the XRP Ledger to my Xahau account on the Xahau network?

Yes. We have an xApp called [**XAH Teleport**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xahau.teleport) that allows you to convert XAH tokens on the XRPL into XAH coins on the Xahau network.

You can read all about it here:

{% endcontent-ref %}

#### What about the "Burn 2 Mint" feature on Xahau?

The Burn 2 Mint feature allows you to burn XRP on the XRP Ledger and generate XAH on the Xahau network on a 1 to 1 basis. For example, using this feature, you could destroy 1 XRP on the XRP Ledger and at the same, create 1 XAH on the Xahau network.&#x20;

We are currently working on xApp to do this but it is still several weeks away from being ready for public release.
