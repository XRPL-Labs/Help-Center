# How to purchase XAH coins

### History

On November 1, 2023 a new XRP Ledger (XRPL) sidechain was launched called **Xahau**.

The Xahau network runs the same code as the XRPL protocol but introduces several new features not found on the main XRPL blockchain.&#x20;

One of the things introduced in Xahau is a new coin with the trading symbol of **XAH**. The primary purpose of XAH is to pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

### Understanding the difference between XAH coins and XAH tokens

The XAH coin is the native currency on the Xahau network. It exists on the Xahau network and can be used to pay transaction costs on the Xahau network.&#x20;

A XAH token is an issued currency on another network. (In this case, the XRP Ledger.) It exists on a different network than Xahau. A XAH token can not be used to pay transaction costs on Xahau and can not be directly moved to the Xahau network.

### How to buy XAH coins

There is currently **no way to purchase XAH coins** using Xaman.

In order to purchase XAH coins, you need to open an account with either of the following two crypto exchanges :

[**GateHub** ](https://signin.gatehub.net/signup)

[**Bitrue**](https://www.bitrue.com/user/register)

In both cases, once you have created an account with them, you will be able to send fiat money to your account with them, then exchange it for XAH coins. Once you have done that, you can refer to the following articles to send your XAH coins to your Xahau account managed by Xaman.

### How to buy XAH tokens

There is currently **one way to purchase XAH tokens** using Xaman:

* Via the XRP Ledger Digital EXchange. (DEX)

The XRPL DEX is basically a large market place where people can buy and sell different assets. You can place buy and sell orders on the DEX for XAH tokens using various websites, utilities or wallets, but Xaman has a built in feature which automates the process for you.

Here's how:

1\) Create a Trust line for the XAH token.

You can do this but pressing the **+Add** button on the main screen of Xaman:

then choose the **XAH (Xahau)** token and press the **Sign to add token** button.

####

#### Can I purchase Xahau coins on the XRP Ledger?

Yes and No.

**Yes.** You can purchase XAH tokens on the XRPL, but they are not the same as the native XAH coins on the Xahau network. By purchasing XAH on the XRPL, you are purchasing a token that **represents XAH**. You are purchasing an IOU for the XAH coin. As long as you purchase the XAH token from a trusted issuer, (ie. GateHub) you have the option to exchange your tokens for 'real' XAH coins on the Xahau network. Owning XAH on the XRPL is more for investors who do not plan to use the Xahau network. They just plan to buy and hold the asset for speculative purposes.

**No.** You can not purchase the **native** XAH coin on the XRP Ledger. The XAH coin **only** exists on the Xahau blockchain. If you plan to interact with the Xahau network, use any of the features of Xahau or participate in the Xahau ecosystem, you will need to acquire XAH coins via a crypto exchange or via the Burn to Mint (B2M) feature.

* Through a crypto exchange  \
  \
  Companies like [Gatehub](https://gatehub.net/) and [Bitrue](https://www.bitrue.com/home/) fully support the Xahau network and will provide services for buying, selling, exchanging, trading, sending and receiving XAH coins.\

* Through the Burn to Mint feature.\
  \
  The Xahau network has a unique "Burn to Mint" (B2M) feature which allows you to convert XRP directly into XAH. XRPL Labs will be releasing a B2M xApp in the near future.
