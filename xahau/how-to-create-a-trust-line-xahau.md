# How to create a Trust Line (Xahau)

There are two easy ways to create Trust Line using Xaman.

1\) Selecting one of the pre-vetted tokens from our **short list**

2\) Visiting **Xahau.Services** and sign using Xaman

### **What is the Xaman short list?** <a href="#what-is-the-xumm-short-list" id="what-is-the-xumm-short-list"></a>

The "short list" is the list of tokens that is presented when you press the _**+Add**_ button on the main screen of Xaman.

Xaman will display a screen that looks like this:

From here you can simply select an issuer, for example, **Gatehub**, then choose which Token you would like to create a Trust Line for, in this case, we'll choose **Euro**, then press **Sign to add Token.**

Xaman will craft a transaction with the details of the Trust Line and after you have reviewed them, you can **Slide to accept**. &#x20;

You should see a warning message cautioning you about the potential dangers. Make sure you read the message, then press **Continue**.&#x20;

Finally, either enter your **passcode/signing password/biometrics** to sign the transaction and the Trust Line will be created.

### **What is Xahau.Services?**

Xahau.Services is a website which allows you to interact with the Xahau network in various ways and to easily create transactions that you can sign with Xaman.&#x20;

In this case, you can use it to create a Trust Line.
