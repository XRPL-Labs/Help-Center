# How to configure a backup signing account

### **Understanding the process before you get started**

The Tangem Backup xApp is designed to simplify the process of creating a regular key between two Xumm (Tangem) cards. By doing this, you will effectively configure one of the cards as a "backup" to the other one. This is not a cloning process where you would make a duplicate a card, this process configures one of the cards to be able to sign transactions on the other card's account.

Don't worry if you can't quite understand it at first. This article will walk you through each step of the process and provide lots of pictures to help.&#x20;

### What we are trying to achieve...

To start, you should have two Xumm (Tangem) cards. Notice that the two cards appear differently...

From now on we will refer to the cards as your **Primary card** and your **Signing Card**.&#x20;

It doesn't matter which one you choose to be your primary or signing card since they are functionally identical, but most people choose the _<mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark>_ card as the Primary card and the _transparent_ card as the Signing card.

When we are done with this process, you will have created an XRPL account on your Primary card, activated it with at least 10 XRP and have created a "link" between your Primary card and your Signing card.

Ideally, you will put the Primary card in a safe, secure place and use the Signing card to sign transactions on the Primary card's account.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan to carry one of the cards with you in your wallet/purse, you would carry the Signing card, not the Primary card.
{% endhint %}

### First things first...

Before you can begin this process, you need to have **two** Xumm cards and **both of them must** be imported into Xumm.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is the number one question we get when it comes to configuring the cards.&#x20;

This process requires that you have two cards and that **each one** of them needs to be added into Xumm **before** you can proceed.
{% endhint %}

This article provides step by step instructions on how to do this:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">How to add a Xumm (Tangem) card</td><td></td><td></td><td><a href="../getting-started-with-xumm/importing-your-account/...a-xumm-tangem-card.md">...a-xumm-tangem-card.md</a></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Image - X.png">Image - X.png</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Since the <mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark> card is going to be your **Primary account**, you will need to activate it with at least 10 XRP.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You **do not** need to activate your **Signing account.** You just need to import it into Xumm.
{% endhint %}

This is where you get to choose your Primary card. This is the one that has been activated with at least 10 XRP. When you have completed the steps in this article, this is the card that will be stored away in a safe place. We refer to it here as **Primary**. Get the <mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark> card, **Slide to accept**, then scan it with your phone.

Get the transparent card, **Slide to accept**, then scan it with your phone.
