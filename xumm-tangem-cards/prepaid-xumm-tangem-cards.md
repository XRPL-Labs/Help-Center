# Prepaid Xumm (Tangem) cards

Let's face it, when it comes to getting started on the XRP Ledger, it can be a little bit complicated if you don't know what you're doing.  We've create articles to try to make the process easier...

* [How to create an XRPL account](../getting-started-with-xaman/your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md)
* [Activating an XRPL account](../getting-started-with-xaman/how-to-activate-a-new-xrpl-account/)

...but we thought to ourselves, "What can we do to make the activation process easier?"&#x20;

We figured if we could provide the option to purchase XRP along with the cards, that would certainly help. So we re-vamped the card purchasing process and added the option to purchase XRP along with the cards.

This article talks about this idea and how to start your journey on the XRP Ledger with a new XRPL account and some XRP to get you going...ðŸ’ª

### Who is this for?

This is for the person who wants an easy way to get started on the XRP Ledger, for someone who might want to give a couple of Xumm (Tangem) cards as a gift, or for someone who just wants an XRP cold wallet without the hassle of having to deal with a third party to activate it.

### Top three reasons you'll like this

* No KYC required - You can purchase up to $50 USD (plus shipping) along with the cards and you don't have to go through the KYC process!
* Safe - The cards are not shipped with an r-address, which means you don't have to worry your account has been accessed on route.
* Convenient - One place to go to purchase the cards and XRP. It is easy to use as a gift.

### How much XRP can you purchase?

Up to $**50** USD worth of XRP **plus** the base reserve.

(Since the price of XRP varies from day to day, the amount of XRP you will receive varies as well.)

For example, if XRP is worth 1 USD each, you could purchase 50 USD of XRP plus the base reserve. (The base reserve for an XRPL account is 10 XRP)&#x20;

So,  Base reserve = 10 XRP x 1 USD each = 10 USD\
&#x20;      Additional 50 USD x 1 USD per XRP - 50 XRP\
&#x20;      Total = You would receive 60 XRP for the cost of 60 USD.

### Can I order them with Xaman Pro?

The first time you order the cards, they come with a free subscription to Xaman Pro.

For those who already have Xaman Pro, the app will detect this and Pro will **not** be included with your purchase.

### Why are shipping costs so high?

Over the last couple of years, the cost to ship the cards has more than doubled. We are in the process of considering other shipping methods, but so far, there is no economical way to ship them around the world. The shipping costs include packaging, processing fees and any special fees levied by our shipping company.&#x20;
