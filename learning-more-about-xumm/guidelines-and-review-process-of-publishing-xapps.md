# Guidelines and review process of publishing xApps

### **History**

In January 2022, we opened the xApp development process up to the XRP community.

Anyone who would like to create their own xApp is now able to do so, but the created xApps will be "sandboxed": they can only be accessed by the developer.

This article is designed to assist you with this process and outline the steps required to get your completed xApp published in Xumm, so other users can open & use your xApp.

&#x20;

### **Summary**

1. Review the guidelines to estimate your chance for success before coding or submitting your xApp for review.
2. Initial review questions that will be asked to determine if you can continue to finish the xApp before submitting the xApp for a final review.
3. Submit your code with a detailed explanation as to what your xApp does.
4. Our development team will review your code, test your xApp and if approved,  will be made available through a direct URL available to all Xumm users.

It is important to note, this **does not** imply that your app will be listed in the Xumm "more xApps" section.

### **Requirements for an xApp**

* xApps need to:
  * add value to a significant share of the Xumm user base
  * have clear instructions for end users
  * be designed in a way that protects users from dangerous mistakes
  * say what it does and do what it says
  * make the source code publicly available and keep it updated\
    \

* xApp developers need to:
  * have gone through the KYC process
  * provide both customer and technical support for their xApp
  * have an easy and clear way to be contacted

### **XRPL Labs reserves the right to:**

* revoke any xApp from the Xumm platform without prior notice if it is deemed necessary to protect our users

Reasons for doing so may include (but not limited to):

* potential harm for users
* lack of customer support
* lack of updates
* promotes speculation (e.g. pushing users towards buying tokens is not allowed)
* involvement in any criminal activity or behavior detrimental to the XRP community
* Licensing issues/infringements

### &#x20;I**nitial Review**

### **Review Process**

* All xApps get reviewed after each release of Xumm.
