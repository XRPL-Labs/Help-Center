### **Frequently asked questions**

#### **What about other XRP Ledger tokens? How to I cash them out?**

Some crypto exchanges support multiple XRP Ledger tokens along with XRP. (Gatehub is a good example of one.) This should be one of the things that you research before you create an account with an exchange. If you find that your current exchange does not support your desired XRP Ledger token, contact them directly and see if they have any plans to do so in the future.
