# Cashing out your XRP

If you are interested in converting some of your XRP into fiat, you have several options.

### **Option 1**

We have partnered with several exchanges, some of which offer off-ramp services.&#x20;

Due to the changing regulations in various countries, you'll need to reach out to your preferred exchange and see if they offer off-ramp services to your region.&#x20;

### Option 2

There are several exchanges in the blockchain space where you can convert XRP into fiat. Some of the bigger players include:

* [Gatehub](https://gatehub.net)
* [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.net)

**Please** make sure that you **thoroughly research** the crypto exchange that you decide to go with. Each exchange has their own rules and fee structures that you should fully understand before signing up. As well, just because we provided a list of exchanges, it does not mean that we support or endorse any of them in any way. It is entirely up to you to decide which crypto exchange you use.

### **Frequently asked questions**

#### **What about other XRP Ledger tokens? How to I cash them out?**

Some crypto exchanges support multiple XRP Ledger tokens along with XRP. (Gatehub is a good example of one.) This should be one of the things that you research before you create an account with an exchange. If you find that your current exchange does not support your desired XRP Ledger token, contact them directly and see if they have any plans to do so in the future.
