# Cashing out with GateHub

### Expanding our partnership with GateHub

For years, GateHub has been a strong member of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) community and has worked with us (and many others) to help expand the ecosystem and make it a great place to do business. Recently we have added a feature to make off-ramping crypto a truly quick and easy process by integrating their platform directly through Xaman (formerly Xumm). This integration makes both on and off-ramping simple and efficient via the GateHub site.

### GateHub's issued stable coins

GateHub is a payment gateway platform that allows you to buy, sell, trade and store digital currency. They have also issued over a dozen different tokens on the XRPL, including XAH, USDT, USDC, GALA, Flare, SGB, EUR, USD and GBP. All of their issued currencies will be honored by them as the actual asset they represent.  The on/off-ramp feature requires the use of GateHub's issued coins.

Note: The information you enter into this screen will be saved for future use. The Contact Name is the name you are going to give this information. Most people would call it, "Bank of America Account" or "Deutsche Bank Account" or "Whatever bank you are going to send your fiat to account".

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How long does it take for me to get my money?

It could take anywhere from 1 to 3 business days for your funds to arrive in your bank account.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Ultimately this depends on how long GateHub takes to process the transaction, and how long your bank takes to process it on their end. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Is there anyway I can track the progress of the transfer?

Unfortunately there is no way to do this. Xaman does not receive any information about the transfer after it has been initiated.

#### Who do I contact if there are delays in getting my money?

GateHub support can be reached [here](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you have any questions about your transfer or:
