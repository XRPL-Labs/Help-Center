# ü™ô Supported tokens

Xaman (formerly known as Xumm) supports both the XRP Ledger and the Xahau blockchain. Any token issued on either network is supported by Xaman.

### **Why doesn‚Äôt Xaman support other blockchains?**

The XRPL protocol is our passion and our specialty and while there are other blockchain technologies that might show promise or potential, we are committed to developing the XRPL ecosystem. Splitting our focus between various blockchains or becoming a ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù wallet is just not in line with our desire to support the XRPL community.

### **Do you plan to support other blockchains?**

No. Our focus is the XRP Ledger and the Xahau network.

### **‚Ä¶ But I see BTC, ETH, SGB, FLR, etc. tokens on the XRPL. How does that make sense if you don't support those networks?**

Those tokens are all issued currencies. They were created on the XRPL/Xahau network to represent specific assets. Anyone can create a token on the XRP Ledger. (Xaman actually contains an xApp called [_**Token Creator**_](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:nixer.tokencreate) to walk you through the process of doing this.)

The BTC/ETH/SGB/FLR tokens that were issued on the XRPL are not the same as the native BTC/ETH/SGB/FLR tokens on their respective blockchains.&#x20;

For example, you can not send BTC issued on the XRPL directly to the Bitcoin network because the Bitcoin network and the XRP Ledger are separate and incompatible networks.&#x20;

People/companies issue tokens on XRPL to enjoy all the benefits of the XRPL but who don't want the limitations or issues associated with other blockchains.

### **So can I send ETH coins directly to the XRPL?**

No. ETH is the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **What about XLM?**

No. XLM is the native token on the Stellar blockchain. The Stellar blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### Can I send XRP using my Lobstr wallet to my XRPL account managed by Xaman?

No. Tokens on the Stellar network can not be directly sent to an XRP Ledger account. As well, Xaman does not support the Stellar network. It only supports the XRP Ledger and Xahau networks.

### **SGB?**

No. SGB is the native token on the Songbird blockchain. The Songbird blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **How about XDC?**

No. XDC is the native token on the XinFin blockchain. The XinFin blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **Where can I see a list of the tokens that you support?**

There is not a definitive and updated list of tokens on the XRP Ledger, but you can do a search for most of them here:

### **Which XRPL tokens are you affiliated with and which ones do you endorse?**

_Xaman is **not** affiliated with any token on the XRPL or the Xahau network and we **do not** endorse any of them._
