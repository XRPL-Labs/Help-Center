# ðŸ“± Got a new phone?

### Three things to get you started...

Congratulations! Getting a new phone can be exciting, but before you get started migrating everything over from your old phone, here are a couple of suggestions to make the process a little smoother...

* Do not get rid of your old phone until your new phone has been properly setup and is working as expected.
* Ensure that you have the account secret (Secret numbers / Family seed / Mnemonic) for your XRP Ledger account.&#x20;
* If you are unsure how to proceed or need clarification on any of the steps in this article, contact us via the [Xaman Support xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support).

### Configuring Xaman on your new phone

The first thing you need to know about getting Xaman (formerly Xumm) working on your new device is that **you can not restore or copy** Xaman from one device to another. Xaman needs to be **installed fresh** on your new phone otherwise you will see this when you launch the app:

If you are already at this error screen, **uninstall** Xaman then continue reading...

To install Xaman on your new phone, you can download it from one of 2 places:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">                         Xaman for iOS</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Apple store big.png">Apple store big.png</a></td><td><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xumm/id1492302343">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xumm/id1492302343</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">                      Xaman for Google Play</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Google store big.png">Google store big.png</a></td><td><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xrpllabs.xumm">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xrpllabs.xumm</a></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Just select one of the above links and press the **Install** button to begin the download.

Although the installation of Xaman is quite straight-forward and user-friendly , you can always refer to our step by step instructions...

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">How to install Xaman</td><td></td><td></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/vault  van gogh style.png">vault  van gogh style.png</a></td><td><a href="../getting-started-with-xaman/installing-xumm.md">installing-xumm.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

When you get to the end of the installation, you will be presented with this screen:

Simply press the **+ Add account** button then choose **Import an existing account**.&#x20;

Next you can choose the appropriate account secret for your XRP Ledger account then enter it into  Xaman to complete the process.&#x20;

### Frequently asked questions

### Why did you ask me to keep my old phone?

We have seen cases where people have forgotten their account secret or recorded their account secret incorrectly. Your old phone should still be able to access your XRP Ledger account(s) in case you run into any trouble configuring your new phone. Once you are able to access and sign transactions on your new device, you can uninstall Xaman from your old device or keep it around as a "backup" just in case something happens to your new phone.&#x20;

### Why can't I restore Xaman from backup?

If Xaman were to store sensitive data, (like your account secrets) in a Google / Apple iCloud backup, an attacker gaining access to your Google / Apple account(s) would be able to restore a backup of your device to their own device, resulting in the loss of your cryptocurrency funds.&#x20;

This is why it's really important to keep your account secret stored offline, in a secure place.

### What about my Xaman (Tangem) card accounts?

If you have Xaman cards, you will need to re-import them into Xaman on your new phone.

If you need assist doing this, check out this article:

### My account was created during the Casino Coin swap. How do I access it?

If you have access to your old CasinoCoin wallet secret in the form of a code that starts with a lower case '**s'**, you can **import your CasinoCoin wallet secret** [**with this link (scan the QR with Xaman)**](https://xumm.app/detect/secret?type=alt-family-seed\&name=CasinoCoin\&alphabet=cpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2brdeCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz).

If you do not have your CasinoCoin secret mentioned above, the CasinoCoin team has documented a process to access accounts created during the CSC swap. You can find the instructions here:

[How to recover a CasinoCoin account](https://eminence.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/80000965171-how-to-recover-a-swapped-casinocoin-xumm-account)

If you run into any trouble with the recovery process, please contact the CasinoCoin support staff here: [CasinoCoin Support](https://eminence.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new)

### I imported my account secret but it did not access my account. My account secret accessed an un-activated account. Do I need to activate it access my original account?

No. In order to access an XRP Ledger account, you need to know the **correct** account secret for it. (Secret Numbers / Family Seed / Mnemonic). As long as you have the correct one, importing the account secret into Xaman **will always** result in the same r-address, with the balance and tokens in place. If you import an account secret into Xaman and you get a different r-address, there are three possibilities:

* it was originally written down incorrectly when you created your account
* it was entered into Xaman incorrectly
* there is another account secret for your XRP Ledger account

The account secret that you entered into Xaman belongs to the XRPL account that is being accessed.&#x20;
