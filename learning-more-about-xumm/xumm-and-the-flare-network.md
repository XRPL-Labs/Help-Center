# Xaman & the Flare network

### **What is the Flare network?**

The Flare Network is a new network which hopes to position themselves as a universal bridging blockchain.

For more information and to keep up to date on Flare’s progress, check out their home page.

### **Is Xaman involved in Flare Networks?**

No. Flare Networks Limited is a separate company from XRPL Labs (the creators of Xaman). Xaman does not support the Spark token, fassets, the Flare airdrop or the Flare network.&#x20;

### **I claimed my Flare tokens using Xaman. You must be involved in some capacity.**

In order to claim the Flare tokens, you would have had to modify your XRP Ledger account with a message key pointing to your Flare address. The Xaman team created a tool that simplified that process. That is the extent of our involvement in the Flare project.

### **Why did Xaman do that?**

Xaman supports all transaction types on the XRP Ledger and is committed to supporting the XRPL community. We created the tool to assist the community with modifying their XRPL accounts.

### **Will my Flare tokens be delivered to my Xaman account?**

No. They will be delivered to your Flare account. \
\
The Flare network is not compatible with the XRP Ledger, so there is no way to move Flare tokens directly back and forth between from them.&#x20;

For more information, please contact Flare Support. They can be reached at:

[Contact Flare](https://flare.network/contact/)

### **Can I still claim my Flare tokens?**

The Flare/Songbird claim period ended on June 11, 2021.

On September 17, 2021, the SGB network was launched and the SGB tokens were distributed.

For more information, please contact Flare Support. They can be reached at:

[Contact Flare](https://flare.network/contact/)

### **Is Xaman compatible with the Flare network?**

No. Xaman is exclusively an XRP Ledger protocol wallet. This means that we support the XRP Ledger and Xahau networks and all of the 8200+ tokens on the XRPL and Xahau. You can not access or interact with the Flare network with Xaman.&#x20;

### **Does Xaman allow FTSO delegation?**

No. Xaman is exclusively an XRP Ledger wallet. We support XRP and all of the 8200+ tokens on the XRPL. You can not access the Flare network with Xaman.

### **… But why can I create a Trust Line to “Flare Spark” then?**

GateHub has issued both Songbird and Flare tokens on the XRP Ledger. You can create a Trust Line to either of these assets, but they were issued on the XRPL, not the Songbird or Flare networks.

For more information about this, please refer to this article:\

### **Can you recommend a Flare compatible wallet?**

No. We don’t know enough about the SGB/Flare network or the various wallets to give an honest recommendation.

You can contact Flare Support for their recommendation. They can be reached at:

[Contact Flare](https://flare.network/contact/)

### **How do I tell if my XRP account is eligible and is registered?**

Go here:

{% embed url="https://xrpscan.com" %}
XRPScan
{% endembed %}

then enter your r-address then click on the **Search** button, then select the **Flare** tab.

You may find the your account is listed as, “**Not eligible**” or “**Not registered**”, in both cases, you need to contact Flare support for assistance in resolving this.

### **Does Xaman provide technical support for Flare Networks?**

No. We provide support for our own products and applications.

For support on anything to do with Flare, please visit their website here:

### **Can I send Flare tokens (Spark) to my XRPL account managed by Xaman?**

No. FLR is the native token on the Flare blockchain. The Flare blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks. You can not access the Flare network with Xaman.
