# Xaman & Fractal ID

### Who is Fractal ID?

Fractal ID is an identity provider who offers KYC services to various blockchains.

### What do they offer?

Fractal had a reward campaign with Ripple, in which Fractal ID users who met the following criteria would be rewarded with 11 XRP tokens:

* Have an approved Plus level KYC in Fractal ID
* Have an XRPL wallet (Our KYC process allows users to onboard directly with Xumm)

### Is the program still active?

As of October 20, 2023, the program is no longer active.

### What is the relationship between Fractal ID and Xumm?

Fractal ID's program required an XRP Ledger wallet in order to participate. Xumm is the premier wallet on the XRPL so many people chose to go through the KYC and direct the funds to their XRPL accounts managed by Xumm.

There is currently no partnership or business relationship between Fractal ID and Xumm.
