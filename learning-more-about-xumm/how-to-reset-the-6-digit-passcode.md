# How to reset the 6 digit passcode

### **Background**

When you install Xaman (formerly Xumm), the first thing it asks you to do is to enter a 6 digit passcode/pin.

This 6 digit code is one of the primary ways to access the Xaman application. (The other way is via Biometrics) If, during the installation of Xaman, you did not select “Extra Security”, the 6 digit passcode is also one of the ways to sign a transaction in the application.

### **I have my 6 digit passcode, I just want to change it**

To change your passcode, launch Xaman, press **Settings** then **Security** then **Change passcode**.&#x20;

Enter in your current passcode, then enter in your new passcode.  You have 1 million possible combinations to choose from. This is one of the primary security measures for protecting your funds so do not choose, 123456, 000000, 11111 or something similar. Your passcode should be difficult to guess.

### **My 6 digit passcode code is not working**

In a case where your passcode is no longer working, you are going to need to uninstall Xaman, then [<mark style="color:blue;">**reinstall Xaman**</mark>](../getting-started-with-xaman/installing-xumm.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">**re-import your account**</mark> ](../getting-started-with-xaman/importing-your-account/)using your account secret.&#x20;

### **I lost my 6 digit code and I need to create a new one**

In a case where you have lost your passcode, the solution is the same as if your passcode is not working. Uninstall Xumm, then [<mark style="color:blue;">**reinstall Xaman**</mark>](../getting-started-with-xaman/installing-xumm.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">**re-import your account**</mark> ](../getting-started-with-xaman/importing-your-account/)using your account secret.&#x20;
