# Getting started with your new cards ðŸ¤—

If you just received your Xumm (Tangem) cards and you are not sure what to do with them or how to configure them, this is exactly where you want to be. We are going to go over the basics of the cards, how to use them, and answer some common questions related to the cards.

### Taking a look at the cards

Most people will receive two cards:

Just to confirm, the cards are exactly the same, other than their appearance. We sent you two different cards so you can easily tell them apart!&#x20;

### What are the cards for...

The main functions of a Xumm card are:

* to securely create an account secret for an XRP Ledger account
* to safely store that account secret on the card
* to sign transactions on the card's account

There are multiple use cases and ways to configure the cards, but the core feature of a card is that it allows you to sign transactions on the XRPL account that the card creates.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since an account secret is generated and stored on each card, the only way you can sign transactions on the card's account, is if you **physically have** the card.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### What the cards are not for...

The cards **can not** be used:

* to connect to your bank account.&#x20;
* at an ATM or bank machine.&#x20;
* as a debit card or a credit card.

### Our recommendation

Here is a summary on how we recommend that you configure the cards:

1\) Import **both** cards into Xaman. (This will create a new XRP Ledger account on each card.)

2\) Activate one of the cards with 10 XRP.  (The second card does not need to be activated.)

3\) Configure the second card to be a backup for the activated card.&#x20;

4\) Move your existing funds (XRP and any other assets) from your existing XRPL account to your new card account.

5\) Decide what to do with your existing account. (Discussed below)



### A little bit more information



**Create a pin on your backup card**

For extra security, consider creating a pin code on you card.

We have compiled a set of suggestions on how to use your Xumm (Tangem) cards. A sort of "Do's and Don'ts" list of things to avoid and things to try to practice when it comes to your cards.

### Additional Questions

#### Tell me more about the "backup " process

The ideal way to configure the cards is to:

* Import two Xumm cards into Xaman
* Create a Primary and Signing account, then link them together using the Tangem Backup xApp.
* Move the majority of your assets to the Primary account, then put the card into a safe, secure storage location.

With the Xumm cards, we utilize the "regular key" feature on the XRP Ledger to accomplish the "link" between cards. You create a new XRPL account on one card. (the "Primary" account) then you create another XRPL account on a second card. (The "Backup" account). Once you have done this, you link the two cards together using the regular key feature on the XRP Ledger. The "link" allows you to sign transactions on the Primary account with the Backup account.&#x20;

The backup is not a duplicate or a clone of an account. The backup is an alternative way to access your XRPL account.

For example, if you were to lose the Backup card (or if it was damaged, stolen, destroyed, etc.) you would just disable the Backup card and use the Primary card to access the Primary account. If you were to lose your Primary card (or if it was damaged, stolen, destroyed, etc.), you would simply move the assets off or your Primary account using the Backup card.

#### I have three cards. What do I do with the third one?

As mentioned above, we use the "regular key" feature of the XRP Ledger to "link' two card accounts together. (This effectively allows the "backup" card to sign transactions on the Primary card's account. ) The XRPL only allows for **one** regular key to be set per account, so this limits the number of backup cards that can be configured to one card.

So what can a third card be used for?

Basically it all depends on how you plan to interact with the XRP Ledger community. For some people. the third card is just put away in a safe place in case something happens to one of the other two cards. (Sort of like a spare card in case one of the others are damaged or lost.)

Some people use it as a dedicated account for gambling, or for NFTs or a dedicated trading account. Some use it for testing features on the XRPL or as a daily spending account.

Other people give it away to a friend or family member to introduce the XRP Ledger to them.

For advanced users, the XRP Ledger has a feature called [**Multi-signing**](https://xrpl.org/multi-signing.html) which allows multiple XRPL accounts to be linked together for signing purposes. The third card can be used in a multi-sign configuration if desired.

So it all comes down to how you are going to participate in the XRPL ecosystem.

#### I have existing XRP Ledger accounts. What should I do with them now that I have the cards?

It depends on how you plan to interact with the XRP Ledger community.

Some people prefer to have multiple XRPL accounts for different functions. For example, you might want to have a dedicated account for airdrops, or for collecting NFTs, or for gambling or for gaming or you might want to use your Xumm cards for long term savings, but you might want a "daily spending" account for routine transactions.

Other people prefer to have one account to manage all their XRP Ledger activity. Once you decide on your plans for the XRPL. you can decide what to do with your account(s).
