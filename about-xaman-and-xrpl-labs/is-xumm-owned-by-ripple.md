# Xaman vs. Ripple

XRPL Labs is a privately owned and operated company based out of the Netherlands.&#x20;

We do not share ownership with Ripple.&#x20;

XRPL Labs received seed funding from Ripple to get started building on the XRP Ledger back but we are 100% independent and privately owned.&#x20;
