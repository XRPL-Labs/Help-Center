# ðŸ˜Ž What is Xaman Pro?

### Background

Xaman (formerly Xumm) is a self-custodial wallet, purpose-built for the XRP Ledger and the [Xahau](https://app.gitbook.com/o/NNsnm9HPzBLfgVAzdj9P/s/m6f29os4wP16vCS4lHNh/) network. It supports all of the features and functions of both the XRPL and Xahau.

Although Xaman provides a full range of features, it became evident that the XRP community desired more than just access to the XRPL/Xahau, which led to the introduction of Xaman Pro.

Xaman Pro is a paid subscription service which provides additional features to the Xaman wallet.

### Current features&#x20;

### Unlimited use of Xaman

We recently began the process of monetizing Xaman.

[understanding-monetization.md](../getting-started-with-xaman/understanding-monetization.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

A subscription to Pro allows you unlimited usage to Xaman. This means that for the period of 1 year, you will be able to use all of Xaman's features as often as you like, without restrictions.

### [**Profiles and Paystring**](features-of-pro/profiles/all-about-profiles.md)

The Profiles feature allows you to create an identity page and a PayString so people can easily send you funds and locate your account on the XRPL.

### [**Push Notifications**](features-of-pro/push-notifications.md)

Push notifications are small, pop-up messages that Xaman will display on your phone to alert you of various transactions on your XRP Ledger account. Push notifications cover real-time transactional messages, updates, support messages and more, all of which will help keep you up-to-date on your XRPL account.

### [KYC verification](../learning-more-about-xumm/kyc.md) (Opt-in)

This feature allows you to go through the KYC process to help verify your identity and add trust to your XRP Ledger and Xahau accounts.

### **Premium Support**

All of our Xaman Pro subscribers receive priority 24 hour, multi-language customer support. Standard support tickets are handled on a 'first come, first served' basis, but with premium support, you 'skip the line' and your tickets are prioritized.

### **Early access to new features**

For those people who want to get involved with the latest and greatest advancements in the XRP Ledger, this feature gets you early access to all of the things we are working on.

### **Free Xaman cards**&#x20;

Each Xaman Pro subscription comes with a pair of free Xaman cards. These NFC cards take your XRP savings accounts to the next level in security.

&#x20;(Note: One pair of cards per customer and the customer must pay the shipping costs of the cards.)

### **Discounts and special offers**&#x20;

Xaman Pro subscribers will get access to special offers and discounts.

See: [Vanity accounts](features-of-pro/vanity-addresses.md)

### **Premium Community Access**&#x20;

A Pro subscription gets you access to Premium sections of the Xaman Community!&#x20;

### Things we're working on for Xaman Pro

#### Multi-sign xApp

Multi-signing on the XRP Ledger is a method of authorizing transactions by using a combination of accounts. (Up to 32 different accounts to be exact.) This xApp will assist advanced users in configuring and using the multi-sign feature on the XRP Ledger/Xahau.

Check out this link for more information the Multi-Signing feature:

#### Encrypted Backup xApp

This xApp will be exclusively for our Xaman Pro subscribers. This one will allow users to backup their account secrets in a safe and easy way. Have you ever worried about losing your secret numbers? That will no longer be a concern once this xApp is released.

#### Escrows - Auto finish

Escrows are a native feature on the XRP Ledger and as they gain in popularity, our users have asked for an easier way to finish an escrow. This xApp will make this process **very** easy.

The shipping costs include packaging, processing fees and any special fees levied by our shipping company.

#### Why does it cost so much to have the cards shipped to me?

Over the last couple of years, the cost to ship the cards has more than doubled. We are in the process of investigating other shipping methods, but so far, we have been unable to find a reliable and economical way to ship them around the world.&#x20;

#### How do I subscribe?

Check out this article for your subscription:

{% content-ref url="how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md" %}
[how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md](how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### How long does a subscription last?

A Xaman Pro subscription last **1 year.**&#x20;

#### **Is this a one time fee or a yearly subscription?**

While we would love everyone to have Pro features forever & for free, developing software and running a software business takes continued investments. A one time payment would not allow us to sustain development, therefore in order to continue to enjoy the features of Xaman Pro, you will need to renew your subscription annuallyâ€¦. but donâ€™t worry, when your subscription is about to end, we will be sure to notify you!

#### **Can I order Pro from anywhere in the world?**

You certainly can but please be aware, there are a couple of countries where we **can not** **ship** the Xaman cards to. These include:

* North Korea
* Iran
* Belarus
* Ukraine
* Vietnam

So while you can subscribe to and enjoy all of the great features of Xaman Pro, unfortunately we will be unable to send you the complimentary Xaman cards.  Reach out to us via the [**Xaman Support xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support) if you have any additional questions about this.

#### **Iâ€™m feeling generous! How do I give Pro as a gift?**

You are probably not surprised to hear this, but many people in the XRP community are VERY generous. For those who wish to give a Xaman Pro subscription as a gift to someone else, we have created as special page to simplify this process for your you.

{% embed url="https://xrpl-labs.com/gift-pro" %}

This link takes you to a page that looks like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Gift Xumm Pro.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Simply press the **Gift directly to r-address** button, enter the r-address of the lucky person and press the _**Purchase**_ button.

#### **Is there a way I can test Xaman Pro to see if I like it?**

Unfortunately not. We do not offer a trial period.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, due to the costs associated with the cards and the KYC process, along with the integration of Profiles into Xaman and the XRP ecosystem, we do not offer refunds on Pro subscriptions, so please make sure you thoroughly review the features before subscribing.
