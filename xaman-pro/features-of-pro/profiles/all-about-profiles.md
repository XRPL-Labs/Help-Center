# All about Profiles

### **What exactly is Profiles?**

The Profiles feature allows you to create an identity page and PayString so people can easily send you funds and locate your account on the XRPL.

Hereâ€™s what a Profile page looks like:&#x20;

### **Why would I want to create a public Profile on the XRPL?**

It is a pretty cool way to represent yourself and it allows you to control your image in the XRPL community. You get your own personal page on the internet which provides an easy way for people to send you funds.&#x20;

### **How do I access my Profile page?**

You just need to open your favorite internet browser and enter your Profile page address.

For example, to get to Kevin's page, you would enter:&#x20;

[xumm.me/kevin](https://xumm.me/kevin)

In your case, your Profile page would match your identity much closer than Kevin's test page. So if your name is John Shepard, your Profile page could be:

<mark style="color:blue;">xumm.me/johnshepard</mark>

or if your name is Daniel Jackson, your Profile page could be:

<mark style="color:blue;">xumm.me/danieljackson</mark>

The general idea is that your Profile page matches your actual identity.

### What is my Paystring?

Your PayString address is an easy way for people to send you funds on the XRP Ledger.

In Kevin's case, his PayString is:

<mark style="color:blue;">kevin$xumm.me</mark>

If you wanted to send XRP to Kevin's account, you could always enter his r-address: **rUBvs5S....**

but many people have trouble remembering r-addresses. It is much easier to send the XRP to: **kevin$xumm.me**&#x20;

Think of PayString like a phone book that links your r-address to an easy-to-remember PayString address.

### How can people find my PayString?

Since all Xumm Profile pages start with: **xumm.me/**\<yourname> you could simply tell people how to find your Profile page, or, since all PayStrings end with: \<yourname>**$xumm.me** your could simply tell them your PayString but we have taken it one step further.

In Xumm, you can actually search for a PayString directly from the Send flow. In this case, we search for "kevin" and Xumm will display the results for you to choose.

It is just like a phone book, you can look up someone's r-address just by knowing their name!  ðŸŽ‰
