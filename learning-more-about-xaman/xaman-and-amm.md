# Xaman & AMM

On March 22, 2024, the AMM amendment was implemented on the XRP Ledger mainnet and Xaman v2.8 was released to support it.

This article answers some frequently asked questions about AMM.

### **What is AMM?**

Put simply, an AMM is basically a big pot of shared assets which is used to exchange different types of assets.

There are plenty of sources of information where you can learn more about the details on how the AMM on the XRP Ledger works, but we recommend starting here:

### What kind of support does Xaman provide for the AMM on the XRP Ledger?

Beginning with v2.8, Xaman fully supports AMM transaction signing on the XRP Ledger.&#x20;

### That sounds just like the way you support other XRPL amendments such as NFTs.

Exactly. When the NFT amendment was implemented on the XRPL, Xaman (formerly Xumm) supported transaction signing for NFT transactions. We left the NFT marketplaces, NFT minting, sales, marketing, technical support, etc., to the community experts to handle. Our focus has always been to help you manage the private keys for your account and provide a safe and secure way to for your to interact with the XRP Ledger.

In the case of the AMM amendment, AMM liquidity pools are a complex financial instrument. We are letting the financial community handle the details of creating and managing the liquidity pools while we continue to focus on our areas of expertise.... namely keeping your account secret safe and secure.

### Are there any AMM service providers that you recommend?

No, not at this time. The AMM amendment is still very new and while there are many AMM services to choose from, we are going to wait and see how the various providers manage their pools and more importantly, how they manage their users before we offer any recommendations.

### Will there be an AMM xApp?

There are currently at least two different developer groups who are working on an AMM xApp for Xaman.  Hopefully there will be ready in the near future.

### How do I provide liquidity to an AMM pool?

Once you have selected an AMM service provider, they should have instructions on how to participate in their liquidity pool. Try reaching out to their customer service team for specific instructions on how to do that.

### How much passive income can I expect to receive by participating in an AMM pool? Enough to retire?

Liquidity pools are not a guaranteed path to consistent income and should not be viewed as a 'get rich quick" investment. AMM's are complicated and often volatile investment instruments that can sometimes lead to passive income but other times, can lead to a complete loss of invested assets.

We strongly recommend that you seek financial advice before investing in an AMM liquidity pool. Any AMM provider that guarantees consistent passive income should be avoided.

### Is there a step by step guide to getting started with AMM on the XRPL?

The first thing to do is to install the latest version of Xaman. Doing that will give you the ability to sign AMM transaction types on the XRPL.

After you have done that, you should research which AMM service providers support the XRPL (and Xaman). There are many to choose from and not all of them provide the same level of customer service and support.  We recommend searching through social media platforms such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc. to see which companies best meet your investment strategies. Once you find a trust worthy AMM service provider with a long history of success and support for the XRP Ledger, reach down to them and arrange an appointment to discuss your financial goals. This is not something you should rush into.
