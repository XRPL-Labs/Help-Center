# Xaman & AMM

On March 22, 2024, the AMM amendment was implemented on the XRP Ledger mainnet.&#x20;

On the same day, Xaman v2.8 was released to support it.

This article answers some frequently asked questions about AMM.

### **What is AMM?**

Put simply, Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts that provide liquidity in the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange. Each AMM holds a pool of two assets and enables users to swap between them at an exchange rate set by a formula.

There are plenty of sources of information where you can learn more about the details on how the AMM on the XRP Ledger works, but we recommend starting here:

### What role does Xaman play in AMMs?

Beginning with version 2.8, Xaman fully supports AMM transaction signing on the XRP Ledger. &#x20;

### That sounds just like the way you support other XRPL amendments such as NFTs.

Exactly. When the NFT amendment was implemented on the XRPL, Xaman (formerly Xumm) supported transaction signing for NFT transactions, but we left the NFT marketplaces, NFT minting, sales, marketing, technical support, etc., to the community experts to handle. Our focus has always been to help you manage the private keys for your account and provide a safe and secure way for you to interact with the XRP Ledger.

In the case of the AMM amendment, AMM liquidity pools are a complex financial instrument. We are letting the financial community handle the details of creating and managing the liquidity pools while we continue to focus on our areas of expertise.... namely keeping your account secret safe and secure.

### Are there any AMM platforms that you recommend?

AMM is still very new and while there are a few companies offering AMM user interfaces, we are going to wait and see how they manage their pools (and their users) before we offer any recommendations.

In the meantime, here's a list of companies that offer AMM interfaces:

* [https://dexfi.pro](https://dexfi.pro)   (link to xApp -> [https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:dexfi.pro](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:dexfi.pro) )
* [https://orchestra.finance/](https://orchestra.finance/)
* [https://xpmarket.com/amm](https://xpmarket.com/amm)
* [https://anodos.finance/](https://anodos.finance/)

### Can I use another AMM platform?

You are free to use whichever AMM interface you like, but please be vigilant when deciding. There are bound to be scam sites out there so make sure you do your research before choosing.

### How do I provide liquidity to an AMM pool?

Once you have selected an AMM service provider, they should have instructions on how to participate in their liquidity pool. Try reaching out to their customer service team for specific instructions on how to do that.

### How much passive income can I expect to receive by participating in an AMM pool? Enough to retire?

Liquidity pools are not a guaranteed path to consistent income and should not be viewed as a 'get rich quick" investment. AMM's are complicated and often volatile investment instruments that can sometimes lead to passive income but other times, can lead to a complete loss of invested assets.

We strongly recommend that you seek financial advice before investing in an AMM liquidity pool. Any AMM provider that guarantees consistent passive income should be avoided.

### How do I report AMM earnings/losses on my taxes?

Each country will have their own rules when calculating gains/losses related to funds invested in AMMs. It is up to you to contact a tax professional in your country to determine the necessary reporting requirements.

### Is there a step by step guide to getting started with AMM on the XRPL?

The first thing to do is to install the latest version of Xaman. Doing that will give you the ability to sign AMM transaction types on the XRPL.

After you have done that, you should research which AMM service providers support the XRPL (and Xaman). There are a few to choose from and not all of them provide the same level of customer service and support.  We recommend searching through social media platforms such as Twitter (X), Discord, Telegram, etc. to see which companies best meet your investment strategies. Once you find a trust worthy AMM service provider with a history of supporting the XRP Ledger, reach out to them and arrange an appointment to discuss your financial goals. This is not something you should rush into.
