# How to Get a Token Added to the Xumm Short List

**What is the Xumm short list?**

The "short list" is the list of tokens that is presented when you press the _**+Add**_ button on the main screen of Xumm.

### **How do I get a token on the Xumm short list**&#x20;

We will **not be adding projects** to the Xumm short list until the XRPL Foundation releases their token vetting program. When the XRPLF's vetting program does become available, tokens wishing to be added to the short list in Xumm will be required to complete a two part process:

1. The issuer must complete the **Self Assessment** portion of the XRP Ledger Foundation's Token Assessment Framework.
2. The issuer must complete and pass a **validation**, **verification** and **compliance vetting** process via the XRPLF's third party auditor.

Once both of these have been successfully completed, your token will automatically be brought to our attention as a candidate for inclusion into Xumm.
