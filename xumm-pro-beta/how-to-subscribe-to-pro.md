# How to subscribe

### Summary

Thank you for your interest Xumm Pro! ðŸ¤—

Xumm Pro is a paid subscription service which provides additional features to the Xaman wallet.

A subscription to Xumm Pro costs **$60 USD** (paid in XRP) or about **$70 USD** if purchased via credit card**.** (This subscription lasts for **1 year** at which time you will be given the option to renew your subscription.)

### Options

There are two ways to subscribe to Xumm Pro, based on how you would like to pay. (Via credit card or with XRP.

Paying with XRP is by far the better option. It allows you to pay instantly, gets you immediate access to Pro, is less expensive ($60 vs. $70) and you can pay directly from Xaman!

### Frequently asked questions

#### When will the cards be shipped?

Most card orders are usually packaged and shipped out the next business day.&#x20;

#### &#x20;I purchased my order with a credit card but Pro is not working.

Once your cards are shipped, you will receive an email with an Xumm Pro activation link. You will need to tap on the link to activate Pro on your device. Keep in mind, orders usually ship the next business day so you might have to wait for a day before your receive the email.

#### I want to order Pro from a desktop computer

If you prefer, we also offer a quick way to purchase Pro directly from a desktop computer.

Simply click on the following link and scan the displayed QR code with Xumm. &#x20;

#### If I don't like Xumm Pro can I get a refund?

Unfortunately we do not offer refunds on the cards or on Xumm Pro subscriptions. (They are a package deal.) Due to the high cost of shipping, the cost associated with services like KYC and the nature of the cards (they generate a key pair upon first use), refunds are just not possible.
