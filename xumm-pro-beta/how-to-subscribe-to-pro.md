In case you're interested, we originally had two different purchase flows in Xumm. (One for Xumm Pro and one for our hardware wallets, (Xumm cards)) The thing is, Xumm Pro always comes with 2 Xumm cards and when you purchase Xumm cards, they always come with a Pro subscription, so why have two separate flows when one will do?&#x20;

So you'll notice that the subscription process takes you through the Xumm card purchase flow. This is how it was designed to work.&#x20;

### **How to subscribe**

1\) You can order the cards from the [Get cards xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.tangem-order) from within Xumm or by launching Xumm, pressing the **xApps** button (on the bottom of the main screen) then choosing **Get cards**.

3\) Chose the number of cards you would like to receive along with your Pro subscription. Most people go with the **2x Card** option, but you choose 2,3,4 or 5 depending on your needs.&#x20;

6\) Choose how you would like to pay for your cards and Pro subscription.

If you are not going to purchase additional XRP, paying with Xumm (in XRP) is quick, easy and will save you money. (We recommend this option.)

If you are purchasing additional XRP, you are going to choose to pay with a Credit Card.

Note: A 10% premium applies (rounded to the nearest 5) for paying with a credit card.

### Frequently asked questions

#### When will the cards be shipped?

Most card orders are usually packaged and shipped out the next business day.&#x20;

Once your cards are shipped, you will receive an email with an Xumm Pro activation link. You will need to tap on the link to activate Pro on your device. Keep in mind, orders usually ship the next business day so you might have to wait for a day before your receive the email.

#### I want to order Pro from a desktop computer

If you prefer, we also offer a quick way to purchase Pro directly from a desktop computer.

Simply click on the following link and scan the displayed QR code with Xumm. &#x20;

#### If I don't like Xumm Pro can I get a refund?

Unfortunately we do not offer refunds on the cards or on Xumm Pro subscriptions. (They are a package deal.) Due to the high cost of shipping, the cost associated with services like KYC and the nature of the cards (they generate a key pair upon first use), refunds are just not possible.
