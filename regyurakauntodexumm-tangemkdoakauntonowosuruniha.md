Paste the r-address for your new Xumm card in the field titled, "XRPL address which will be able to sign transactions", then press the **Send Set Regular Key to Xumm** button.

#### Step 6: Sign the transaction with your existing account <a href="#h_daeec8d8c2" id="h_daeec8d8c2"></a>

Sign the transaction in Xumm and you're all done!&#x20;

### What is the recommended way to configure my Xumm cards?

The recommended and ideal way to configure a card is to have **two cards**, then "link" them together using the Tangem Backup xApp. This is explained in this article:

[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### I only have one card though...

Each card will generate and store an XRP Ledger account secret on the card.

The account secret can not be viewed and extracted from the card and anytime you want to sign transaction on the card's account, you must have the card with you.

This is a great security feature but since the account secret only exists in one place, (on the card) what would happen if you lost or damaged the card? (You would lose access to your funds!)

This is why we only sell a minimum of two cards. With two Xumm cards, you can create a backup card which allows you to access your funds in case one of them is ever lost or damaged.

If you only have one card, "linking" an existing account to it allows your existing account to act as a backup in case something happens to the card.
