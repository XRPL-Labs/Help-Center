# ðŸ’¡ Understanding monetization

{% hint style="info" %}
Xamanâ€™s monetization model is a necessary step to secure our future as the most trusted, secure, and feature-complete software wallet for the XRPL ecosystem. Sustainability is critical for us to continue delivering the high-quality experience you rely on without compromising what matters most: **your security and a seamless user experience**.
{% endhint %}

The alternative would mean cutting cornersâ€”sacrificing the very principles that make Xaman a cornerstone of the ecosystem. We refuse to let that happen. We understand how important Xaman is to you, and weâ€™re committed to keeping essential features like sending transactions **always free**, no matter what.

To ensure Xaman remains resilient and innovative, weâ€™re asking the most active usersâ€”the power usersâ€”to contribute. If you exceed the monthly dynamic usage threshold, some advanced features will require a small fee to unlock. **For those who prefer to pay for monetization with crypto, you can easily do so by purchasing Xaman Pro** with **XRP** at [xrpl-labs.com/pro](https://xrpl-labs.com/pro). With Xaman Pro, youâ€™ll enjoy unlimited access to all features without thresholds, offering both convenience and flexibility.

## How Does Monetization Work?

Our monetization model is designed to be fair and inclusive, ensuring casual users can continue to enjoy Xaman for free while power users and businesses contribute to our sustainability.

Here are the key elements:

1. **Usage-Based Charging**

* The usage threshold is dynamic. It is calculated based on the average usage of all Xaman users each month, ensuring fairness and adaptability.
* After exceeding the usage threshold, advanced features may require a nominal fee.
* The usage threshold resets every month.
* Using the '**Send**' button remains free for all users, ensuring essential functionality is always available.
* Users can use all of Xaman's features and functions for free up to a certain monthly activity level.
* Your usage is measured over a rolling 30-day period. If heavy use is followed by low use, you will roll out of monetization just as you roll in. The system adjusts dynamically based on your recent activity.
* **Exemption for XAH Holders**: If you hold over **5,000 XAH on the Xahau Network** in your Xaman wallet, you are **exempt from all monetization charges**.
* There are 6 monetization tiers. You can read more about them below.

2. **Yearly Subscription: Xaman Pro**

* For unlimited usage, users can [**subscribe to Xaman Pro**](../xaman-pro/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md) for a flat annual rate.
* Pro subscribers are exempt from threshold-based charges and enjoy uninterrupted access to all features.



This dual approach ensures casual users are not burdened while giving power users the flexibility to choose the plan that best suits their needs.

## **Monetization Tiers: Tailored for Fairness**

To ensure fairness and adaptability, Xamanâ€™s monetization model uses **six tiers**, each reflecting your app usage. These tiers are:

* **$0.99**
* **$1.99**
* **$3.99**
* **$5.99**
* **$9.99**
* **$19.99**

The more you use the app, the higher the tier you may reach. However, itâ€™s important to note that the jump between tiers becomes increasingly more difficult to achieve as usage escalates. For example, moving from **$9.99 to $19.99** requires **exponentially more activity**, such as signing thousands of transactions per month or engaging with the app hundreds of times per day.

These tiers are billed in **your local currency**, ensuring a seamless and accessible experience for users around the globe. By keeping these tiers usage-based and dynamic, we maintain fairness while continuing to support Xamanâ€™s growth and innovation.

## Why Did Xaman Introduce Monetization?

The decision to monetize was not taken lightly. Hereâ€™s why we believe itâ€™s the right step for Xaman and the XRPL ecosystem:

1. Ensuring Sustainability\
   Grants and donations, while valuable, are unpredictable. Monetization ensures Xaman has a reliable revenue stream to support ongoing development, reducing dependency on external funding and enabling us to plan for the long term.
2. Driving Quality and Innovation\
   Monetization allows us to reinvest in Xaman, accelerating the pace of updates, testing, and new feature rollouts. This ensures users always have access to cutting-edge tools that meet the highest quality standards.
3. A Thriving Ecosystem\
   For the XRPL ecosystem to grow, projects like Xaman need to be self-sufficient. Monetization sets a precedent for building robust, interconnected platforms that can innovate and flourish without external reliance.
4. Enhanced User Support\
   Sustainable revenue allows us to expand and strengthen our support infrastructure, ensuring timely and effective assistance for all users.

## What If I Choose to Leave Xaman?

If you decide that Xaman no longer meets your needs, you have two options:

1\) Transfer your funds to a **Centralized Exchange** (Moderate Risk)

You can transfer your XRP to a centralized exchange, but this comes with moderate risks. Centralized platforms have a history of breaches and failures, making user assets vulnerable.

[sending-tokens-from-xumm.md](sending-tokens-from-xumm.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2\) Transfer your XRPL account to another **Self-Custodial Wallet** (Safer Option)

You can import your wallet into another trusted self-custodial solution using your private keys.

[moving-your-xrpl-account-to-another-wallet.md](../learning-more-about-xumm/moving-your-xrpl-account-to-another-wallet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Important: Only use verified, reputable wallets to avoid scams. Double-check the walletâ€™s authenticity before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

We remain committed to providing the safest, most reliable, self-custodial wallet experience for XRPL users. However, if you choose to move on, we encourage you to do so responsibly.

## Frequently asked questions

### How are threshold usage levels determined?

The fees are calculated using various factors, but it boils down to how active you are on Xaman and your account value. If you open xApps 1000 times a month, you are a power user. If you sign 1000 transactions a month, you are a power user. If you hold over 100,000 XRP with Xaman, you are a power user. These are a few examples of metrics used to determine the threshold.

For example:

A) Are you a long-term investor who uses Xaman to check their balance once a month, set a few trustlines and transact a few times?&#x20;

In these cases, Xaman will remain free to use since you rarely use the app.

B) Are you a long-term investor who uses Xaman to check their balance every day, once an hour, and transact 20 times per day?&#x20;

At some point you will notified you are approaching "above average use" and be asked to pay to continue using Xaman. Checking user balance once an hour would be considered above average user.

### Is there a lifetime subscription option?

No, currently we only offer monthly and yearly payment options.&#x20;

For an unlimited access to Xaman for 1 year, you can subscribe to Xaman Pro:

{% content-ref url="../xaman-pro/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md" %}
[how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md](../xaman-pro/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Do I have to subscribe to Xaman Pro?

No, you can continue to use Xaman for free. If you eventually reach the usage threshold, you will be prompted to make a payment. You do not need to subscribe to Xaman Pro unless you would like unlimited access for 1 year.

### **What payment options are available?**

We accept **Google Pay** and **Apple Pay.**

### **I live in an area where I can't use Google Pay. What are my options?**

We are finding that most people are subscribing to [**Xaman Pro** ](../xaman-pro/what-is-xumm-pro.md)which offers 1 year of unlimited use and can be purchased **using XRP.**&#x20;

### **Did You Announce This Before?**

Yes, we first announced our monetization model in **September** through our [blog](https://xaman.app/blog/building-a-sustainable-future-for-xaman-introducing-monetization-and-revenue-sharing) and **social media**. Since then, we've shared additional updates, including more [blog articles](https://xaman.app/blog/xaman-3-2), tweets, and an **in-app announcement** to ensure everyone had plenty of notice in advance.

We understand this might be new to some, but we've worked hard to communicate this change transparently over the past few months. If youâ€™d like to dive deeper into why and how this works, check out our blogs for all the details.

### **How Does "Restore Purchase" Work?**

If youâ€™ve purchased a subscription or paid for a tier, the "Restore Purchase" feature ensures you donâ€™t pay again when reinstalling the app or switching devices.

* Log in with the same **Google Play** or **Apple ID** account used for the purchase.
* Tap "Restore Purchase" in the app settings.
* The app will verify your purchase and restore your access.

If it doesnâ€™t work, double-check your order.
