# 💡 Understanding monetization

Xaman has become a cornerstone of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem, trusted by users and developers for its security, innovation, and user-first approach. From the beginning, grants and community support have been instrumental in building Xaman into one of the most vital wallets on the XRPL. However, as the ecosystem grows, sustainability has become critical.

Xaman’s monetization model is launching soon to ensure a sustainable future while continuing to deliver the high-quality features and security you trust. This change will impact only the most active users, while casual users will remain unaffected.&#x20;

If you exceed the monthly dynamic usage threshold, some advanced features will be restricted, but sending transactions will always remain free. Users can pay a small fee to regain unrestricted access or subscribe to Xaman Pro for a flat annual fee, offering unlimited use without thresholds.

### How Does Monetization Work?

Our monetization model is designed to be fair and inclusive, ensuring casual users can continue to enjoy Xaman for free while power users and businesses contribute to our sustainability.

Here are the key elements:

1. **Usage-Based Charging**

* The usage threshold is dynamic. It is calculated based on the average usage of all Xaman users each month, ensuring fairness and adaptability.
* After exceeding the usage threshold, advanced features may require a nominal fee.
* The usage threshold resets every month.
* Using the '**Send**' button remains free for all users, ensuring essential functionality is always available.
* Users can use all of Xaman's features and functions for free up to a certain monthly activity level.
* Your usage is measured over a rolling 30-day period. If heavy use is followed by low use, you will roll out of monetization just as you roll in. The system adjusts dynamically based on your recent activity.
* **Exemption for XAH Holders**: If you hold over **5,000 XAH** in your Xaman wallet, you are **exempt from all monetization charges**.

2. **Yearly Subscription: Xaman Pro**

* For unlimited usage, users can [**subscribe to Xaman Pro**](../xaman-pro-beta/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md) for a flat annual rate.
* Pro subscribers are exempt from threshold-based charges and enjoy uninterrupted access to all features.

This dual approach ensures casual users are not burdened while giving power users the flexibility to choose the plan that best suits their needs.

### Why Did Xaman Introduce Monetization?

The decision to monetize was not taken lightly. Here’s why we believe it’s the right step for Xaman and the XRPL ecosystem:

1. Ensuring Sustainability\
   Grants and donations, while valuable, are unpredictable. Monetization ensures Xaman has a reliable revenue stream to support ongoing development, reducing dependency on external funding and enabling us to plan for the long term.
2. Driving Quality and Innovation\
   Monetization allows us to reinvest in Xaman, accelerating the pace of updates, testing, and new feature rollouts. This ensures users always have access to cutting-edge tools that meet the highest quality standards.
3. A Thriving Ecosystem\
   For the XRPL ecosystem to grow, projects like Xaman need to be self-sufficient. Monetization sets a precedent for building robust, interconnected platforms that can innovate and flourish without external reliance.
4. Enhanced User Support\
   Sustainable revenue allows us to expand and strengthen our support infrastructure, ensuring timely and effective assistance for all users.

### What If I Choose to Leave Xaman?

If you decide that Xaman no longer meets your needs, you have two options:

1\) Transfer your funds to a **Centralized Exchange** (Moderate Risk)

You can transfer your XRP to a centralized exchange, but this comes with moderate risks. Centralized platforms have a history of breaches and failures, making user assets vulnerable.

{% endcontent-ref %}

2\) Transfer your XRPL account to another **Self-Custodial Wallet** (Safer Option)

You can import your wallet into another trusted self-custodial solution using your private keys.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Important: Only use verified, reputable wallets to avoid scams. Double-check the wallet’s authenticity before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

We remain committed to providing the safest, most reliable, self-custodial wallet experience for XRPL users. However, if you choose to move on, we encourage you to do so responsibly.

## Frequently asked questions

#### How are threshold usage levels determined?

The fees are calculated using various factors, but it boils down to how active you are on Xaman and your account value. If you open xApps 1000 times a month, you are a power user. If you sign 1000 transactions a month, you are a power user. If you hold over 100,000 XRP with Xaman, you are a power user. These are a few examples of metrics used to determine the threshold.

For example:

A) Are you a long-term investor who uses Xaman to check their balance once a month, set a few trustlines and transact a few times?&#x20;

In these cases, Xaman will remain free to use since you rarely use the app.

B) Are you a long-term investor who uses Xaman to check their balance every day, once an hour, and transact 20 times per day?&#x20;

At some point you will notified you are approaching "above average use" and be asked to pay to continue using Xaman. Checking user balance once an hour would be considered above average user.

#### Is there a lifetime subscription option?

No, currently we only offer monthly and yearly payment options.&#x20;

For an unlimited access to Xaman for 1 year, you can subscribe to Xaman Pro:

{% content-ref url="../xaman-pro-beta/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md" %}
[how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md](../xaman-pro-beta/how-to-subscribe-to-pro.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Do I have to subscribe to Xaman Pro?

No, you can continue to use Xaman for free. If you eventually reach the usage threshold, you will be prompted to make a payment. You do not need to subscribe to Xaman Pro unless you would like unlimited access for 1 year.

**What payment options are available?**

We accept **Google Pay** and **Apple Pay.**

**Can I pay in XRP?**

Not yet. Apple and Google policies currently prohibit us from offering XRP as a payment method in the app. However, we hope to introduce this option if platform rules evolve in the future.
