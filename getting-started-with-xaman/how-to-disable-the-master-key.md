# How to disable the Master key

### Why disable the Master key?

There are two main reasons why you would want to disable the Master key for an XRPL account:

* Your account has been compromised
* You want to configure your account so that you can only sign and submit transactions using a regular keyed account.&#x20;

### Before you get started

You should confirm that you have the correct account secret for your account.

[**How to test your Account Secret**](how-to-test-your-account-secret.md)

Once you have done this, you should be aware of the following before you proceed:

1\) To disable the master key pair, **you must use the master key pair.**&#x20;

2\) Your account must have at least one method of authorizing transactions other than the master key pair. e.g. - assign a regular key

3\) Once the Master key has been disabled, you will not be able to use it to re-enable your Master key. It can only be re-enabled using the assigned regular key account.

### Make sure you configure a Regular key account

The XRP Ledger will not let you disable the Master key unless there is an alternate way to sign and submit transactions. This article explains how to do this by adding a regular key to your account.
