You can import an XRP Ledger account in either of these two modes:

**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

If you decide to import your account in Read only access mode, stop, and refer to this article:

* [**Import an account in Read only mode**](...in-read-only-mode.md)

Otherwise, choose **Full access** and press the **Next** button. You should see this screen:

Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets but in this case we will choose **Family Seed** then press **Next**.

A Family seed is a string of numbers and letters that is 29 characters long that starts with the letter "s".&#x20;

For example: s4rj7hy5vdth65f4fy89hg4ffh77hg

Enter your Family seed then press **Next**.&#x20;

Please ensure that r-address that is displayed is the one that you intend to import. If it is **not correct**, please press the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">button, then double check and re-enter your Family seed. When the correct r-address is displayed, press the **Confirm** button.

You should see the following screen:

| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (3).png>)     | Standard security is a great option your daily spending account. You can sign with your 6 digit passcode or enable biometrics and sign with your face/finger print. |
| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (2) (2).png>) | Extra security allows you to enter a separate signing password. This is the best option for your long term storage account.                                         |
