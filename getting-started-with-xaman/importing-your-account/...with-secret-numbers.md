You can import an XRP Ledger account in either of these two modes:

**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

If you decide to import your account in Read only access mode, stop, and refer to this article:

* [**Import an account in Read only mode**](...in-read-only-mode.md)

Otherwise, choose **Full access** and press the **Next** button. You should see this screen:

Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets. In this case we will choose the Secret Numbers.

When you created your XRP Ledger account using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers consisting of 8 rows, (A-H), each with 6 digits.  You will need to have those numbers in order to proceed.

We are going to choose the **Secret numbers** option and press **Next**.

Enter the secret numbers for your account using the buttons and press the **Next** button when complete.

Please ensure that r-address that is displayed is the one that you intend to import. If it is **not correct**, please press the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">button, then double check and re-enter your secret numbers. When the correct r-address is displayed, press the **Confirm** button.

| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (3).png>)     | Standard security is a great option your daily spending account. You can sign with your 6 digit passcode or enable biometrics and sign with your face/finger print. |
| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (2) (2).png>) | Extra security allows you to enter a separate signing password. This is the best option for your long term storage account.                                         |

Once you decide, select it and press **Next** then enter the account label and press **Next** to complete the import process.
