# Installing Xaman

### **Welcome!**

If you are reading this, you’ve decided to install Xaman (formerly Xumm) on your mobile device. Congratulations! You are about to start your journey into the XRP Ledger ecosystem and Xaman will be your guide. Welcome aboard!

### Xaman compatibility (Device requirements)

Generally, Xaman is compatible with most devices that run either:

⦁ Android v7 and up

&#x20;⦁ iOS v13 or higher and an iPhone 7 or newer

(There are literally 1000's of different devices running dozen of different versions of Android (v7 - v11) and iOS (v13 - v17) so it is not possible for us to list them all here. Needless to say, as long as you are running a current version of the above operating systems, Xaman should work properly.)

As well, officially Xaman does not support tablets such as Apple iPads. While you may be able to install and run Xaman on some versions, our UI has not been upscaled to match the various screen sizes and most tablets do not support NFC.&#x20;

Finally, we have encountered issues with the following devices:

* On the Samsung A50, A51, Samsung A71 and Motorola One Action phones, there are known issues on Android 10. After updating to Android 11 the Samsung A51 and A71 will work just fine.
* There are known NFC issues with Android devices by Nokia, like the Nokia 8.1. If you intended to use a Xaman card on these phones, the cards will not work.

### **Getting started…**

Installing Xaman is a simple and straightforward process. From start to finish it should take you about 10 minutes to complete.. but don’t rush through it! You are going to need to write down some **very** important information, so take your time, grab a pen and some paper and get comfortable. Together we going to go through this...

Xaman can only be download from 1 of 2 places:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Xumm for iOS</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Apple store big.png">Apple store big.png</a></td><td><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xumm/id1492302343">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xumm/id1492302343</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Xumm for Google Play</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Google store big.png">Google store big.png</a></td><td><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xrpllabs.xumm">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xrpllabs.xumm</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Just select one of the above links and press the **Install** button begin the download.

Once the download has completed, press the **Open** button to begin the Xaman installation process and you should be presented with this screen:

Press the **Start** button to begin.

Press **Go** to get to the passcode setup page.

Here is where you enter the 6 digit passcode which you can use to unlock and access Xaman once the installation has completed. When done, press **Next** then re-enter your new passcode and press the **Save** button.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Try to avoid using a simple passcode such as 123456, 000000, 111111, 222222, etc. since these could be easily guessed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You will see the Biometric Authentication screen next. Here you can choose **Yes** if you would like to be given the option to sign into Xaman using biometrics and/or sign transactions using biometrics. If you are unsure about this, you can always enable this feature later.

On this screen, you get the option to enable push notifications on your phone. If you are unsure about this, you can always enable the feature later.

The ensuing 9 screens display import information about how Xaman and the XRP Ledger work, our Terms of Service and the current release notes. You will need to acknowledge that you have read through each page to continue.
