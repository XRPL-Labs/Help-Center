# How to enable the Master Key

### Before you get started

In order to disable the master key for an XRP Ledger account, you must configure another way to sign on your account. The process to do this is called, 'setting a regular key'.  You must set a regular key before you are able to disable the master key on an account.

For example:

In this case, you can see that a separate account (ra433z72...) has been configured to sign for the main account. (rGVTc5FPz....)

### Disabling your Master key

1\) Go to [XRPL.services](https://xrpl.services/)

2\) Press the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (6).png>) button then press **Open in Xumm App** and sign in with the account the you would like to enable your Master key on.
