# Xaman On/Off Ramp

In December 2022, we introduced our Xumm On/Off Ramp Service (XOORS) allowing our Pro users who lived in  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to move fiat currency to and from the XRP Ledger.

Xaman Pro (formerly Xumm Pro) users could quickly and efficiently send fiat currency (Euros) from their traditional bank account to their Xaman account for conversion into XRP.

Introducing this service was a bold and risky initiative embraced by our users and praised in the XRP Ledger community.&#x20;

Our rates were exceptionally competitive, our customer service surpassed the big crypto exchanges and our security infrastructure was industry leading. It was difficult to find another platform that compared to our to price, service, security and convenience.&#x20;

### All good things must come to an end...

Alas, our On/Off Ramp service was not meant be.

A number of factors forced us to discontinue XOORS.

1\) The regulatory landscape in the crypto industry has made it very difficult (and expensive) to offer fiat exchange services. Almost all countries have released new regulations related to crypto services. We are no longer able to realistically navigate the existing and emerging regulations.

2\) The profit margins on our exchange rates were so low, it required a large quantity of transactions in order make our service viable in this competitive sector. There just were not enough community members utilizing our services.

&#x20;3\) Our focus on the XRP ecosystem meant a smaller and more focused user base. Crypto exchanges often cater to dozens or even hundreds of different blockchains. Our commitment solely to the XRP Ledger severely limited the number of potential users.&#x20;

Overall, the ecosystem we are active in, combined with the regulatory landscape, lack of volume and  increasing requirements, do not allow us to keep on offering our On/Off Ramp service.

### Moving forward

There is a silver lining to this unfortunate turn of events...

{% hint style="info" %}
We have increased our collaborations with our On Ramp partners like [Uphold](https://buy-sell-xrp.xumm.app/) to streamline and further integrate Xaman with their platform. As well, in the coming months, we plan to bring on another On ramp partner for you to pick from. (We certainly don't want you to be left without any options!)
