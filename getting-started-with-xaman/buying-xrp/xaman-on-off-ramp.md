# Xaman On/Off Ramp

In December 2022, we introduced our On/Off Ramp service which allowed our Pro users who lived in  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to move fiat currency to and from the XRP Ledger.

Xaman Pro (formerly Xumm Pro) users could quickly and efficiently send fiat currency (Euros) from their traditional bank account to their Xaman account and convert it into XRP.

When it came time to "cash out" their XRP, Pro users could use the service to convert XRP back into fiat and send their fiat back to their bank account.

Introducing this service was a bold and risky initiative which was widely embraced by our users and praised in the XRP Ledger community. Our rates were exceptionally competitive, our customer service rivaled the big crypto exchanges and our security infrastructure was industry leading. It was difficult to find another platform that compared to our to price, service, security and convenience.&#x20;

### All good things come to an end...

Alas, our On/Off Ramp service was not meant be.

A number of factors have come to pass which have forced us to discontinue our On/Off Ramp service.

1\) The regulatory landscape in the crypto industry has made it very difficult (and expensive) to offer fiat exchange services. Almost all countries have released new and extreme laws and oversights related to crypto services. We are no longer able to realistically navigate through the existing and emerging regulations.

2\) The lack of volume in the XRP coin has resulted in an unprofitable service. The profit margins on our exchange rates were so low, it required a large quantity of transactions in order make our service viable in this competitive sector. There just were not enough community members utilizing our services.

&#x20;3\) Our focus on the XRP ecosystem meant a smaller and more focused user base. Crypto exchanges often cater to dozens or even hundreds of different blockchains. Our commitment solely to the XRP Ledger severely limited the number of potential users.&#x20;

Overall, the ecosystem we are active in, combined with the regulatory landscape, lack of volume and  increasing requirements, do not allow us to keep on offering our On/Off Ramp service.

### Moving forward

There is a silver lining to this unfortunate turn of events...

We have increased our collaborations with our On Ramp partners like [Uphold](https://buy-sell-xrp.xumm.app/) to streamline and further integrate Xaman with their platform. In the coming months, new&#x20;



Effective immediately, anyone attempting to sign up with our Xaman On/Off Ramp Service (XOORS) will receive the following message:

but&#x20;

&#x20;f time to add a warning/note to our documentation @Will Wonta - e.g. take down an article, or put up a big red warning that XOORS is no longer offered but » insert link to partneronramp

1. We'll cater existing XOORS users for a little bit, and existing onboarding flows can be finished, but they will, just like everyone else: ...»
2. &#x20;but instead we're increasing our collaborations with onramp partners like Uphold (link to xApp) to streamline and further integrate
3. We understand that they may have purchased Pro and KYC specifically for XOORS. Which we understand feels bad. We will credit them the spent 65€ in XAH to their r-address on Xahau network (this one is pending @Alex Bewier approval and requirements)
