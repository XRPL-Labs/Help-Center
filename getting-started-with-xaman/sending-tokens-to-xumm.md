# Sending tokens to Xumm

**Introduction**

If you are new to Xumm, it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, it does get easier after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send funds using Xumm.

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that all tokens issued on the XRP Ledger use the same r-address to send and receive as XRP does.

For example, if you want send XRP to your account, you would send it to your r-address. In Xumm you can find your r-address here:

Now, letâ€™s say you want to send another token to your account, for example, CasinoCoin (CSC), you would send it to the same r-address as you would if you were sending XRP. (In this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

â€¦and if you wanted to send a different token to your account, maybe, Sologenic (SOLO) or Coreum (CORE) or Elysium (ELS), they would all use the same r-address. (Again, in this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

In all of the above cases, the relevant Trust Line needs to be set before the token will show as an asset in the destination account.

### **Each Trust Line has its own r-addressâ€¦**

In order to receive and hold a particular XRP Ledger token, (there are over 8200 of them), you need to create a Trust Line to their project.

Letâ€™s look at the CasinoCoin (CSC) project for example.

The CasinoCoin project issued the CSC token back in March of 2021 from this r-address:

**rCSCManTZ8ME9EoLrSHHYKW8PPwWMgkwr**

If you would like to hold CSC tokens in your account, you will need to create a Trust Line to their issuing account.&#x20;

When you create a Trust Line, you are basically saying that you have researched their project and are satisfied that they are a trustworthy company.

{% hint style="danger" %}
One final note, you should never send tokens back to an issuing account. Doing this will destroy them. If you are unsure about this, please contact us to discuss.
