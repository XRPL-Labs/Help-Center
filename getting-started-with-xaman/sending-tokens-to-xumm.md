# Sending tokens to Xaman

**Introduction**

If you are new to Xaman (formerly Xumm), it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, **it does get easier** after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send funds using Xaman.

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that all tokens issued on the XRP Ledger use the same r-address to send and receive as XRP does.&#x20;

For example, if you want send XRP to your account, you would send it to your r-address. In Xaman you can find your r-address here:

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, your r-address will be different than our r-address. Our account is a [Vanity r-address](../xumm-pro-beta/features-of-pro/vanity-addresses.md).
{% endhint %}

The second thing to know as that you **can not receive tokens** unless you have configured a Trust Line for those tokens.

In our case, we have one Trust Line configured in our account:

* XAH (Xahau)

You can see it here:

The final thing, which might be the most important thing, is that you **never send tokens to the tokens issuing account**. If you do that, you will destroy them. (More on this later.)

### Putting it all together

Let's go through an example of how it works.

We want to receive a token in our account. In this case we want to receive Euro tokens (EUR) issued by GateHub. The problem is that we do not have a Trust Line configured in our account for EUR so we can not receive them, so we need to create one.

Here's how to do that:

[how-to-create-a-trust-line.md](how-to-create-a-trust-line.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Now we have two Trust Lines configured. Here is how Xaman looks after we create the EUR Trust Line.

### **Each Trust Line has its own r-addressâ€¦**





Now, in our case, letâ€™s say we had another XRPL account and we wanted to send tokens to it. For example, CasinoCoin (CSC), we would send the tokens the same r-address as we would if we were sending XRP. (In this case, **rstargateUoNLmD683...**)

â€¦and we wanted to send a different token to our account, maybe, Sologenic (SOLO) or Coreum (CORE) or Elysium (ELS), we would still use the our same r-address. (Again, in this case, **rstargateUoNLmD683...**)

Keep in mind, in all of the above examples, the relevant Trust Line would need to be setup before the token will show as an asset in the destination account.

{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Each Trust Line has its own r-addressâ€¦**

In order to receive and hold a particular XRP Ledger token, (there are over 8200 of them), you need to create a Trust Line to their project.

Letâ€™s look at the CasinoCoin (CSC) project for example.

The CasinoCoin project issued the CSC token back in March of 2021 from this r-address:

**rCSCManTZ8ME9EoLrSHHYKW8PPwWMgkwr**

If you would like to hold CSC tokens in your account, you will need to create a Trust Line to their issuing account.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you create a Trust Line, you are basically saying that you have researched their project and are satisfied that they are a trustworthy company.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
One final note, you should never send tokens back to an issuing account. Doing this will destroy them. If you are unsure about this, please contact us to discuss.
