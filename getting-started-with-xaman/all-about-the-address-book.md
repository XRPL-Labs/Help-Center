# All about the Address Book

### **Background**

One of the nice features of Xaman is the ability to create and store a list of contacts in an Address Book. This article discusses how to create contacts and use them in Xaman.&#x20;

### **How to find the Address Book**

The Address Book can be found by clicking on **Settings** -> **Address Book**.

### **How to add a contact to the Address Book**

To add a new contact to your Address book tap the "**+**" button.

You will see this screen:

In the "**Name:**" field, enter the name of your contact.

In the "**Address:**" field enter the r-address of your contact.

(If applicable)

In the "**Destination tag**" field enter the destination tag for your contact's account.

When done, tap the "**Save**" button.

Note:&#x20;

* Self-custody accounts on the XRP Ledger do not require Destination Tags unless they are specifically configured. &#x20;
* Custodial accounts (like the ones created by crypto exchanges) **do** require Destination tags. Make sure you enter the correct destination tag otherwise your funds may not been delivered to the expected custodial account.
{% endhint %}

### **How to use the contacts in your Address Book**

During the send flow,  after you enter the amount to send. you will see the "Recipient" screen. You should see a list of your contacts from your Address Book so you can choose one. (You may need to scroll down to see them.)

In this example, we selected the crypto exchange, Bitrue from the Address Book.

You will notice that the Destination Tag has been automatically inserted into the correct field.

(As long as you add the correct Destination Tag in the contact, Xaman will populate the information in the send flow.)

### **Adding a contact from your Event list**

Rather then manually entering a contact, you choose one from the Event list and have Xaman do it for you.&#x20;

Open the Event list and choose the transaction which contains the r-address of the person you want to create a contact for.

Press the three dots beside the r-address you would like to add.

Tap the, "+ Add to contacts" button.

You will be taken to the Contact create screen.

You will notice that the r-address has been populated for you.

At this point you just need to add the Contact Name, then tap the **Save** button.
