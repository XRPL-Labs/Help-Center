# All about the Address Book

### **Background**

One of the nice features of Xaman is the ability to store an r-addresses in an Address Book. This article discusses this feature and how to use it.

&#x20;

### **How to find the Address Book**

The Address Book can be found by clicking on **Settings** -> **Address Book**.

You should see this screen:

In the "**Name:**" field, enter the name of your contact.

In the "**Address:**" field enter the r-address of your contact.

In the "**Destination tag**" field enter the destination tag for your contact's account. (If applicable)

When done, tap the "**Save**" button.

{% hint style="success" %}
Note:&#x20;

* &#x20;Self-custody accounts on the XRP Ledger do not require Destination Tags unless they are specifically configured. &#x20;
* Custodial accounts (like the ones created by crypto exchanges) **do** require Destination tags. Make sure you enter the correct destination tag otherwise your funds may not been delivered to the expected custodial account.
{% endhint %}

### **How to use the contacts in your Address Book**

During the send flow,  after you enter the amount to send. you will see the "Recipient" screen. You should see a list of your contacts from your Address Book listed so you can choose one. (You may need to scroll down to see your Contact list):

In this example, we selected the crypto exchange, Bitrue from the Address Book.

You will notice that the Destination Tag has been automatically inserted into the correct field.

(As long as you add the correct Destination Tag in the contact, Xaman will populate the information in the send flow.)
