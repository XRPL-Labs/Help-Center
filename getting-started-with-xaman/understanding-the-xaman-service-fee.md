# 💙 Understanding the Xaman Service Fee

To ensure long-term sustainability while maintaining an exceptional user experience, Xaman has transitioned to an industry-standard service fee model.

This update eliminates the previous threshold-based monetization and replaces it with a transparent, per-use fee structure. Fees are applied only to specific transactions that require extensive processing resources or involve trading activity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Most regular transactions remain free**

**Market trading has a small 0.8% fee with a minimum of 0.09XRP**

**Yield-products incur a 0.5% fee**

**Pathfinding transactions cost a fixed-fee of 0.15 XRP**

**High Value Xaman Service Fee on Payments over $50,000**
{% endhint %}

### Transactions That Are Free

The vast majority of user activity remains unaffected. The following transactions are free for all users:

* Sending XRP up to $50,000 USD in value
* Sending tokens up to $50,000 USD in value
* Receiving any amount of XRP or Tokens.
* Trust Line creation and modifications (TrustSet)
* Removing Trust Lines
* Canceling offers
* Deleting accounts on the XRP Ledger
* Minting & Listing NFTs
* NFT trading
* AMM creation and voting
* Account settings modifications (AccountSet)

### Trading and High-Load Transactions

To maintain optimal performance and security, Xaman now applies a small fee to transactions that require additional infrastructure resources:

**Trading Transactions (0.8% service fee, minimum 0.09 XRP per transaction):**

* Token swaps
* AMM deposits and withdrawals
* Market trades on the XRP Ledger DEX&#x20;

### **Small Fixed Fees for Certain Transactions**

**The following bear a fixed fee per transaction.**

* Pathfinding payments (0.15 XRP fee due to additional computational complexity)
* Limit orders incur a fixed 0.09XRP fee

### High-Value Transactions

To reinforce Xaman’s position as the leading self-custodial wallet in security and reliability, transactions exceeding $50,000 will incur a **0.1% service fee**, while transactions over $100,000 will have a **0.07% service fee**.&#x20;

These thresholds apply to large-value movements between the same source and destination within a rolling 12-hour window.

Our brand is built on trust and a flawless track record spanning more than half a decade. As the tip of the spear in crypto infrastructure and wallet security, this framework ensures we continue delivering the resilience, protection, and reliability our users expect, now and in the future.

#### Yield Products

To support yield integrations and the extra infrastructure required to keep them reliable, **deposits into supported yield products incur a 0.5% Xaman service fee**.

* **Applies to:** deposits into yield products
* **Does not apply to:** withdrawals, reward claims, or receiving funds
* **Transparent before signing:** you will always see the exact service fee before confirming the transaction

**Why a yield fee?**\
XRPfi doesn’t build itself. To deliver yield products in a secure and trusted way inside a self-custody wallet, we invest in integrations, infrastructure, and ongoing support. This one-time fee applies to the deposit only, while the potential yield can continue afterwards. Yield rates and outcomes depend on the provider and market conditions.

### Why This Change Was Made

This update brings Xaman in line with industry standards used by wallets across the XRP Ledger, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems. By moving to a per-use fee structure instead of a usage threshold model, Xaman ensures:

* **A sustainable and independent financial model**
* **No arbitrary limitations or access restrictions**
* **Users pay based on actual usage rather than a pre-set threshold**

These changes support Xaman’s mission to deliver best-in-class self-custodial security, ongoing innovation, and continued growth.

### Frequently asked questions

**I want to send over 50,000 USD worth of XRP to my XRP Ledger account managed by Xaman. Do I have to pay a fee?**

**I want to send over 50,000 USD worth of XRP from my XRP Ledger account managed by Xaman. Do I have to pay a fee?**

Yes.  Any payment transaction where you send $50,000 USD or more **from** your XRP Ledger account managed by Xaman will incur a **0.1% service fee**, while transactions over $100,000 will have a **0.07% service fee.**



**When do the service fees reset?**

Fees do not 'reset' in a traditional sense. Fees are based on a rolling balance.

For example, if you subscribed to Pro on August 1, you have 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply.

**Case 1**

Let's say you do 25 token swaps on the same day (August 1), you will have to wait 30 days before your feeless trades start again. In this case, you would have to wait until August 31. On August 31, you would get 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply again.

**Case 2**

On August 1st you do your first swap with a value of $100 USD, on August on 2nd, you do another swap with a value of $100 , on August 3rd you do another swap for $100 USD and so on until August 10th. (So a total of $1000 USD)&#x20;

Thirty days later, on September 9, you will have $100 USD worth of trades. If you do not do any trades on September 9th, on September 10th, you will have another $100 worth of trades. If you do not do any trades on September 10th, on September 11th, you will have another $100 USD of trades and so on until September 19th, when you will have $1000 USD worth of transactions.    &#x20;

**Case 3**

On August 1st you do your first swap with a value of $500 USD. On August 10th you do another swap of $500. You have used up your $1000 USD in free trades. You will be charged fees on your other swaps until until August 31st. On August 31st, you will have $500 USD in free trades.&#x20;

If you do a trade on September 2nd for $250 USD and another trade on September 3rd for $250 USD, you will need to pay fees until  September 9th, when you will have $500 worth of trades. (Since it has been 30 days from August 10th when you placed an order for $500)

**Case 4**
