# ðŸ’™ Understanding the Xaman Service Fee

To ensure long-term sustainability while maintaining an exceptional user experience, Xaman has transitioned to an industry-standard service fee model.

This update eliminates the previous threshold-based monetization and replaces it with a transparent, per-use fee structure. Fees are applied only to specific transactions that require extensive processing resources or involve trading activity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Most transactions remain free**

**Market trading has a small 0.8% fee with a minimum of 0.09XRP**

**Limit orders have a flat fee of 0.09 XRP**

**Pathfinding transactions cost a fixed-fee of 0.15 XRP**

**High Value Xaman Service Fee on Payments over $50,000**
{% endhint %}

### Transactions That Are Free

The vast majority of user activity remains unaffected. The following transactions are free for all users:

* Sending XRP up to $50,000 USD in value
* Sending tokens up to $50,000 USD in value
* Receiving any amount of XRP or Tokens.
* Trust Line creation and modifications (TrustSet)
* Removing Trust Lines
* Canceling offers
* Deleting accounts on the XRP Ledger
* Minting & Listing NFTs
* NFT trading
* AMM creation and voting
* Account settings modifications (AccountSet)

### Trading and High-Load Transactions

To maintain optimal performance and security, Xaman now applies a small fee to transactions that require additional infrastructure resources:

**Trading Transactions (0.8% service fee, minimum 0.09 XRP per transaction):**

* Token swaps
* AMM deposits and withdrawals
* Market trades on the XRP Ledger DEX&#x20;

### **Small Fixed Fees for Certain Transactions**

**The following bear a fixed fee per transaction.**

* Pathfinding payments (0.15 XRP fee due to additional computational complexity)
* Limit orders incur a fixed 0.09XRP fee

### High-Value Transactions

To reinforce Xamanâ€™s position as the leading self-custodial wallet in security and reliability, transactions exceeding $50,000 will incur a **0.1% service fee**, while transactions over $100,000 will have a **0.07% service fee**.&#x20;

This measure ensures the security and continued development of infrastructure that safeguards large-scale transfers.

### Xaman Pro and 5000+ XAH Holders

Xaman Pro users and holders of 5,000 or more XAH tokens continue to benefit from reduced fees:

* **25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions per 30 days** OR **$1,000 in total trading volume per 30 days before fees apply**
* **Pro users who purchased before February 1, 2025, will enjoy a full year of completely fee-free trading**

This adjustment ensures that high-activity users receive premium benefits while maintaining the best experience for the broader user base.

### Why This Change Was Made

This update brings Xaman in line with industry standards used by wallets across the XRP Ledger, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems. By moving to a per-use fee structure instead of a usage threshold model, Xaman ensures:

* **A sustainable and independent financial model**
* **No arbitrary limitations or access restrictions**
* **Users pay based on actual usage rather than a pre-set threshold**

These changes support Xamanâ€™s mission to deliver best-in-class self-custodial security, ongoing innovation, and continued growth.

**When do the fees reset?**

Fees are based on a rolling balance.

For example, if you subscribed to Pro on August 1, you have 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply.

**Case 1**

Let's say you do 25 token swaps on the same day (August 1), you will have to wait 30 days before your feeless trades reset. In this case, you would have to wait until August 31. On August 31, your fees would reset and you would get 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply again.

**Case 2**

On August 21 you do your 25th token swap. You have to wait 30 days before your feeless trades reset. In this case, you would have to wait until September 24th. On September 24th, your fees would reset and you would get 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply again.

**Case 3**

You do 10 tokens swaps on August 15th. You do not do any more trades. On September 14 your feeless trades reset. On September 14th, you would get 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply again.

**If I don't use my 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market** **trading transactions during the 30 day window (or $1,000 in total trading volume), do they carry over into the next 30 days?**

No. Fees are based on a rolling balance and reset every 30 days.

For example, if you subscribed to Pro on August 1, you have 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR $1,000 in total trading volume before fees apply.&#x20;

If you do not use your 25 feeless tokens swaps, AMM deposits, AMM withdrawals and/or market trading transactions OR do $1,000 in total trading volume within 30 days, your fees reset. They do not carry over into the next 30 days.
