# ðŸ’™ Understanding the Xaman Service Fee

To ensure long-term sustainability while maintaining an exceptional user experience, Xaman has transitioned to an industry-standard service fee model.

This update eliminates the previous threshold-based monetization and replaces it with a transparent, per-use fee structure. Fees are applied only to specific transactions that require extensive processing resources or involve trading activity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Most transactions remain free**

**Trading has a small 0.8% fee with a minimum of 0.09XRP**

**Pathfinding transactions cost a fixed-fee of 0.15 XRP**

**High Value Xaman Service Fee on Payments over $50,000**
{% endhint %}

### Transactions That Are Free

The vast majority of user activity remains unaffected. The following transactions are free for all users:

* Sending XRP up to $50,000 USD in value
* Sending tokens up to $50,000 USD in value
* Receiving any amount of XRP or Tokens.
* Trust Line creation and modifications (TrustSet)
* Removing Trust Lines
* Canceling offers
* Deleting accounts on the XRP Ledger
* Minting & Listing NFTs
* NFT trading
* AMM creation and voting
* Account settings modifications (AccountSet)

### Trading and High-Load Transactions

To maintain optimal performance and security, Xaman now applies a small fee to transactions that require additional infrastructure resources:

**Trading Transactions (0.8% service fee, minimum 0.09 XRP per transaction):**

* Token swaps
* AMM deposits and withdrawals
* Trading on the XRP Ledger DEX&#x20;

### **Small Fixed Fees for Certain Transactions**

**The following bear a fixed fee per transaction.**

* Pathfinding payments (0.15 XRP fee due to additional computational complexity)
* Limit orders incur a fixed 0.09XRP fee

### High-Value Transactions

To reinforce Xamanâ€™s position as the leading self-custodial wallet in security and reliability, transactions exceeding $50,000 will incur a **0.1% service fee**, while transactions over $100,000 will have a **0.07% service fee**.&#x20;

This measure ensures the security and continued development of infrastructure that safeguards large-scale transfers.

### Xaman Pro and 5000+ XAH Holders

Xaman Pro users and holders of 5,000 or more XAH tokens continue to benefit from reduced fees:

* **25 feeless trading transactions per month** OR **$1,000 in total trading volume per month before fees apply**
* **Pro users who purchased before February 1, 2025, will enjoy a full year of completely fee-free trading**

This adjustment ensures that high-activity users receive premium benefits while maintaining the best experience for the broader user base.

### Why This Change Was Made

This update brings Xaman in line with industry standards used by wallets across the XRP Ledger, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems. By moving to a per-use fee structure instead of a usage threshold model, Xaman ensures:

* **A sustainable and independent financial model**
* **No arbitrary limitations or access restrictions**
* **Users pay based on actual usage rather than a pre-set threshold**

These changes support Xamanâ€™s mission to deliver best-in-class self-custodial security, ongoing innovation, and continued growth.
