# How to get the Glacier Airdrop

### Background

The Midnight Glacier Drop is the first phase of the Midnight NIGHT token distribution.

The NIGHT token is the native token in the Midnight blockchain.



### How is Xaman involved?

The Midnight blockchain has not been launched yet. In an effort to generate interest in the new blockchain, the Midnight team is conducting this airdrop for users on following networks (ADA, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, AVAX, and BAT).

Since the XRP Ledger is one of the targeted networks, we are providing this information as a courtesy to our users.&#x20;

Xaman is not affiliated with the airdrop, does not manage or distribute any tokens, and has no role in its execution. Our only involvement is to inform our users and help protect them from scams.

Currently, Xaman Wallet is the **only XRP Ledger wallet** officially supported by the project. This article is intended to provide clear instructions for our valued users to make the process easier.
