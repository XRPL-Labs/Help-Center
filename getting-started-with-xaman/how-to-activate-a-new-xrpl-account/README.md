# Activating an account (XRPL)

In order to be able to hold XRP (or any of the 25,000+ tokens issued on the XRP Ledger) in an XRPL account, it must first be activated with a minimum of 1 XRP.

An account can be activated several ways but regardless of how it is activated, the first 1 XRP deposited into an XRPL account will be used to meet the reserve requirements and will not be spendable (unless and until the account is deleted and the reserve gets moved to another account).

If you're interested, this video explains how reserves and fees on the XRP Ledger work.

After you create a new XRP Ledger account in Xaman (formerly Xumm), you are presented with the following screen:

There are four way to activate an XRPL account:

* **Option 1**

You can purchase XRP from one of our partners to activate your account.

* **Option 2**

You can activate your account from another XRPL account in Xaman&#x20;

* **Option 3**

You can activate your account from an external source like a crypto exchange

* **Option 4**

You can activate your account from an external source like another XRP Ledger account

###

### **Option 1, 2**

The first two options can be done via Xaman by pressing the  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (4).png>) button:



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/activation 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your first option is to purchase XRP from one of our partners.

Pressing the, '**Buy XRP**' button gets you into the purchase flow:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Buy and sell.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Press the down arrow in the "Select your country or currency" field then choose your country or currency and you will see a list of service providers for your region.

Select the appropriate service provider by pressing the '**Open xApp**' and follow the instructions provided on the screen.



Your second option is to fund your new XRPL account from an existing XRPL already imported into Xaman.

Pressing the, '**Fund with existing account**' button gets you into Xaman send flow.

Choose your existing account in Xaman that has already been activated and has at least 1 XRP available for spending. You will be sending it to your new account.

You can choose any of the pre-determined amounts but the first 1 XRP will be ear marked for the account reserve.  When done, press the **Activate** button then review the transaction and **Slide to Accept**.



{% hint style="warning" %}
You will notice that there is a third option, **Fund via an exchange**. Choosing this option does **not actually activate** your account. It simply provides instructions on _how_ to send XRP from your exchange account to your XRPL account managed by Xaman.
{% endhint %}



### Option 3

There are several crypto exchanges in the blockchain space which also sell XRP. Some of the bigger players include:

For instructions on how to send XRP from one of the above exchanges, simply click on the name of the exchange and follow the steps.

If your exchange is not listed above, here are the generic instructions which should help sending from your exchange:

{% content-ref url="../sending-xrp-to-xaman.md" %}
[sending-xrp-to-xaman.md](../sending-xrp-to-xaman.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please** make sure that you **thoroughly research** the crypto exchange that you decide to purchase from. Each exchange has their own rules and fee structures which you should fully understand before signing up.&#x20;

Furthermore, just because we have provided a list of exchanges, it does not mean that we support or endorse any of them in any way. It is entirely up to you to decide which crypto exchange you use.
{% endhint %}

### Option 4

Finally, you can activate your new XRPL account by sending 1 XRP from **another** XRPL account.

For example, if you have a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. who has an activated account, you can have **them** activate your account by having them send 1 XRP to it.

Here is how they can send XRP to Xaman:
