### How does "pre-funding" work?

1\) You  either order the cards or if you subscribed to Pro, you claim them.

2\) When we send your cards, we pick one and scan the serial number of the card/

3 When you import the card into Xaman, it detects the serial number and looks to see if there is a pre-funded amount waiting to be claimed. ( Normally 1 XRP).

4\) After the card creates it's account secret, you will see this screen with the, "Avtivate your account" button.

6\) Tap the, "Activate" button and we will send 1 XRP to your newly created Xaman card account.

3\) s order the cards, the price includes 1 XRP that can be applied to your XRP Ledger account after you import it into Xaman.  The 1 XRP will be used to meet the  base reserve requirement of the XRP Ledger.
