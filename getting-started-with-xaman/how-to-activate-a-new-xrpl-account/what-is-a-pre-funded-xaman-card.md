### How does "pre-funding" work?

1\) You  either order the cards or claim them if you subscribed to Pro.

2\) When we send your cards, we pick one and attach 1 XRP to the card.

3\) s order the cards, the price includes 1 XRP that can be applied to your XRP Ledger account after you import it into Xaman.  The 1 XRP will be used to meet the  base reserve requirement of the XRP Ledger.
