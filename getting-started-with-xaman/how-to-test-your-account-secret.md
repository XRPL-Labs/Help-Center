# How to test your Account Secret

Do you have multiple XRP Ledger accounts?&#x20;

What would happen if you mixed up your account secrets (Secret numbers / Mnemonics / Family Seeds) and didn't know which one belonged to which account?

Xumm has a way for you to check!&#x20;

### Getting started

1\) Launch Xumm and press the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2) (3).png>)button at the top right hand corner of the screen, then press <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

You should see this screen:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add an account screen.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2\) Press the **Import an existing account** button. You will see:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Account type.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3\) Press the **Next** button.  You should see this screen:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Secret type.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4\) Choose the Account Secret type matching the account secret that you have. (Secret numbers / Family Seed / Mnemonic) then press the **Next** button.

5\) Enter your Account Secret then press the **Next** button.\
\
For example, secret numbers would look like this:\
\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (3) (1).png>)\
\
If your account is already imported into Xumm, you will receive the follow message:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Account Secret belongs.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If your account is not already imported into Xumm, you will receive a screen that displays the r-address that the account secret belongs to.
