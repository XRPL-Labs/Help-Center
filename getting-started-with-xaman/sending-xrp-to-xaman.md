# Sending XRP to Xaman

**Introduction**

If you are new to Xaman (formerly Xumm), it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, **it does get easier** after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send XRP from another XRP Ledger (XRPL) account to your XRPL account managed by Xaman.

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that your XRPL account is identified by an "r-address'.

Here is where you can find you r-address in Xaman.

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, your r-address will be different than our r-address. Our account is a [Vanity r-address](../xaman-pro/features-of-pro/vanity-addresses.md).
{% endhint %}

Your r-address basically is your account number on the XRP Ledger. It is the address that you will send your XRP to.

You should also know that there are two types of accounts on the XRPL.

* **Self custodial** accounts - All accounts managed by Xaman are self custodial accounts. (After all, Xaman is a self custodial wallet.) With a self custodial account, you are solely responsible for managing your private keys.
* **Custodial** accounts - A company is responsible for managing the private keys to their account. (Usually a crypto exchange.) You are provided an account address from the exchange and a (unique to your exchange) destination tag.

{% hint style="info" %}
Destination Tags are usually required when using exchanges. Some exchanges give a different Destination Tag for each transaction. Some exchanges re-use the same Destination Tag for all transactions for your account. make sure you know how your exchange works.
{% endhint %}

Since this article talks about how to send XRP to your XRPL account managed by Xaman, you will not need a destination tag.&#x20;

See this article for more details about Destination Tags:

## The '**Send Flow**'

Obviously we can not provide step-by-step instructions for every crypto wallet or crypto exchange. (There are just too many of them and they continually change their applications. We can't keep up with all of them!)

This is how to send XRP from another device with Xaman installed on it, to your XRPL account managed by Xaman.  The steps are similar to what you will find in other wallets.

### **Step 1**

From the main screen in Xaman, press the **Send** button.

Most wallets have a 'send' or 'withdraw' button of some kind. You should be able to easily find the send or withdraw option on your platform/wallet.

For example, in GateHub it looks like this:

In Kraken, it looks like this:

On the next screen, you will see the option to enter the **amount** you would like to send.

(You can also change the account you would like to send the tokens **from** and you can change the **type** of token you would like to send.)

In our case, we are going to send 1 XRP.

Press the **Next** button to continue.

### **Step 2**

In this screen you can enter the **recipient's** account that you are sending your tokens to.

Press **Next** after you have entered/selected the correct destination r-address.

### **Step 3**

Finally we reach the **Summary** screen. Here you can review your transaction to make sure it is correct.

After you have confirmed the parameters (destination r-address, amount) are correct, simply **Slide to send** and your transaction will be sent to the XRP Ledger to process.

### Sending XRP from a crypto exchange account

Each crypto exchange will have their own instructions for sending XRP.

In the table below, you can find instructions for some of the more popular exchanges.
