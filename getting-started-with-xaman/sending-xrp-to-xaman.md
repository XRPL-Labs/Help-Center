# Sending XRP to Xaman

**Introduction**

If you are new to Xaman (formerly Xumm), it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, **it does get easier** after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send XRP from another XRP Ledger (XRPL) account to your XRPL account managed by Xaman.

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that your XRPL account is identified by an "r-address'.

Here is where you can find you r-address in Xaman.

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, your r-address will be different than our r-address. Our account is a [Vanity r-address](../xaman-pro/features-of-pro/vanity-addresses.md).
{% endhint %}

Your r-address basically is your account number on the XRP Ledger. It is the address that you will send your XRP to.

You should also know that there are two types of accounts on the XRPL.

* **Self custodial** accounts - All accounts managed by Xaman are self custodial accounts. (After all, Xaman is a self custodial wallet.) With a self custodial account, you are solely responsible for managing your private keys.
* **Custodial** accounts - A company is responsible for managing the private keys to their account. (Usually a crypto exchange.) You are provided an account address from the exchange and a (unique to your exchange) destination tag.

{% hint style="info" %}
Destination Tags are usually required when using exchanges. Some exchanges give a different Destination Tag for each transaction. Some exchanges re-use the same Destination Tag for all transactions for your account. make sure you know how your exchange works.
{% endhint %}

Since this article talks about how to send XRP to your XRPL account managed by Xaman, you will not need a destination tag.&#x20;

See this article for more details about Destination Tags:

## The '**Send Flow**'

Obviously we can not provide step-by-step instructions for every crypto wallet and crypto exchange. (There are just too many of them and they continually change their applications. We can't keep up with all of them!)&#x20;

You goal is to find the "**Send**" option or the "**Withdraw**" option.

In Xaman it looks like this:

In GateHub it looks like this:

In Kraken, it looks like this:

In Coinbase, it looks like this:

From there, you often have to choose the **amount** you would like to send.

Here is how it looks in Xaman.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Send screen - 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will also need to know the **r-address** that you are sending to.

Your r-address basically is your account number on the XRP Ledger. It is the address that you will send your XRP to.

See above on how to get your r-address in Xaman.

In Xaman, you would enter would enter the **recipient's** account that you are sending your tokens to here.

At this point, you might be asked to choose a  "**Network type**". Many exchanges still refer to the XRP Ledger as the "Ripple" network, or simply the "XRP" network.

You will have to contact your exchange if they call the XRP Ledger something else and it is not obvious.

Finally, many exchanges as for a **destination tag**. XRP Ledger accounts do not require a Destination Tag/Memo ID/XRP tag unless they have been specifically configured to require one.

If you exchange or wallet demands that you enter one, you can make up any number you like and try using it. For example, most people use this one: **1234** . In some cases, the exchange requires a 5 or 6 digit number, in which case, you could try: 12345 or 123456.

In Xaman, the **Summary** screen is where you can review your transaction to make sure it is correct and where you would enter a destination tag if you needed to.

In the table below, you can find instructions for some of the more popular exchanges.

### Frequently asked questions

#### How long does it take for me to get my funds?

Transactions on the XRP Ledger take about 4 seconds to complete, so after your exchange submits the transaction to the XRPL, you should see your XRP in your account almost immediately.

...unless your exchange does not submit your transaction to the XRP Ledger right away. In many cases, the exchange will say, "Your transaction has been submitted for processing", or "Your transaction is complete, we will submit it shortly." Remember, crypto exchange control your funds. They can decide if they want to send them, when they want to send them and where they want to send them. We've seen cases where an exchange waited 18 hours before submitting a transaction to the XRP Ledger. You are at their mercy when it comes to accessing your funds with them.

If your funds do not arrive in your account within a minute or two, you should be contacting your exchange and find out what the delay is all about.
